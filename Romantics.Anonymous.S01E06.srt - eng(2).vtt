00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.833
Huh?

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.208
I confessed my feelings to you?

00:00:14.708 --> 00:00:15.541
Yes.

00:00:16.541 --> 00:00:18.916
So I'll give this back to him for you.

00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:23.041
W-Why are you telling me this now?

00:00:23.916 --> 00:00:26.083
I just wanted to protect your pride.

00:00:26.583 --> 00:00:29.125
Why would you protect my pride?

00:00:29.833 --> 00:00:31.041
Because

00:00:32.541 --> 00:00:33.958
I felt sorry for you.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.458
You felt sorry for me?

00:00:38.541 --> 00:00:40.208
Well, of course.

00:00:40.875 --> 00:00:43.250
You're one step away from heartbreak.

00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:45.625
It's upsetting, knowing you'll get hurt.

00:00:45.708 --> 00:00:47.791
Even if I do, that's my problem.

00:00:47.875 --> 00:00:50.166
Why are you upset?

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.958
No, I'm not upset.

00:00:53.041 --> 00:00:56.708
I figured you,
my employee, might be upset.

00:00:56.791 --> 00:01:00.416
Please let your employee
handle her own problems!

00:01:01.125 --> 00:01:02.541
You even lied.

00:01:03.791 --> 00:01:05.333
I didn't lie.

00:01:06.083 --> 00:01:09.125
To be honest,
I am interested in you, Hana.

00:01:09.208 --> 00:01:10.291
Huh?

00:01:10.375 --> 00:01:11.958
-Huh?
-Hm?

00:01:12.791 --> 00:01:14.166
Uh…

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.791
You're what?

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.291
Of course… I'm interested.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.750
I'm interested in
my employee's emotional well-being.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.208
Because I'm your boss.

00:01:29.416 --> 00:01:30.583
Right!

00:01:30.666 --> 00:01:33.708
Take care of your health.
Come to work on time, even if it's hard.

00:01:33.791 --> 00:01:34.625
Good night.

00:01:35.375 --> 00:01:36.708
Wait, what?

00:01:52.625 --> 00:01:54.416
Sorry about earlier.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.916
So, this is about my childhood.

00:02:02.833 --> 00:02:06.708
My mom was addicted to love.

00:02:06.791 --> 00:02:11.916
Whenever something went wrong,
she'd try to kill herself.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.375
She was probably trying
to get their attention.

00:02:21.166 --> 00:02:25.458
And I was always the one
cleaning up after her mess.

00:02:26.083 --> 00:02:28.500
At first, I was shaken up.

00:02:29.916 --> 00:02:32.333
But after a few times,
I came to a realization.

00:02:33.541 --> 00:02:38.083
My mom… couldn't love herself.

00:02:40.541 --> 00:02:42.333
And in her circle of love,

00:02:43.333 --> 00:02:45.000
there was no room for me.

00:02:53.041 --> 00:02:55.041
I'M SORRY. I FOUND LOVE.
I HOPE YOU WILL TOO.

00:02:55.125 --> 00:02:55.958
And then,

00:02:56.875 --> 00:02:59.166
she left me.

00:02:59.791 --> 00:03:02.333
I studied like crazy,
as if to get revenge.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.083
I swore I'd never live for a guy.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.958
I'd never do anything
that would destroy my life.

00:03:13.125 --> 00:03:14.500
That's what I decided.

00:03:19.333 --> 00:03:22.291
You know, I may be cute,

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.958
but I'm not a good person,
and I'm not cut out for romance.

00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:33.125
So you deserve someone better than me.

00:03:33.958 --> 00:03:37.041
Who's better than you?

00:03:43.666 --> 00:03:46.166
What are you doing this weekend?

00:03:48.625 --> 00:03:50.000
I'm attending a conference.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.041
I see.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.333
After that…

00:03:59.208 --> 00:04:00.333
are you free?

00:04:01.875 --> 00:04:03.625
I'm staying overnight in Nagano.

00:04:04.666 --> 00:04:05.916
Can I have my coat back?

00:04:09.291 --> 00:04:10.583
No.

00:04:13.333 --> 00:04:14.583
Maybe next time.

00:04:16.333 --> 00:04:17.958
Let's meet by chance again.

00:04:43.125 --> 00:04:47.958
TWO-WAY CONFISERIE

00:04:48.041 --> 00:04:50.291
This Two-way Confiserie

00:04:50.375 --> 00:04:54.041
uses wine from Château Nagano,
a major winery in Nagano.

00:04:54.125 --> 00:04:57.125
Lavender is its signature symbol.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.208
The name "Two-way" comes from its design
to please both the eyes and the palate.

00:05:07.375 --> 00:05:08.500
Is that correct?

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.791
That's right.

00:05:13.333 --> 00:05:15.291
The lavender on top is just decoration,

00:05:15.375 --> 00:05:21.041
so the flavor depends on
the raisin filling soaked in Nagano wine.

00:05:21.708 --> 00:05:22.750
Um,

00:05:23.625 --> 00:05:25.791
is there another problem?

00:05:25.875 --> 00:05:27.625
No, there's no problem.

00:05:27.708 --> 00:05:32.625
But I still wonder
if this is the best we can do.

00:05:36.041 --> 00:05:36.875
So,

00:05:37.958 --> 00:05:42.375
I thought we could all look for
ways to improve the flavor.

00:05:43.916 --> 00:05:46.208
Let's visit the winery in Shinshu

00:05:46.291 --> 00:05:47.625
as a corporate retreat.

00:05:50.416 --> 00:05:51.250
What?

00:05:51.333 --> 00:05:54.375
Mr. Fujiwara! Can the floor staff go too?

00:05:56.708 --> 00:05:57.958
Of course.

00:05:58.583 --> 00:06:01.916
Yeah! All right!

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.541
Thank you, sir!

00:06:03.625 --> 00:06:08.041
If we're going, we could use some help
from a professional sommelier.

00:06:08.125 --> 00:06:09.708
-True.
-Good point.

00:06:10.875 --> 00:06:11.750
I know!

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:14.333
How about asking Hiro from Brush?

00:06:14.416 --> 00:06:18.958
-Um…
-If it's him, I'm all for it!

00:06:19.041 --> 00:06:20.250
I'll call him.

00:06:20.333 --> 00:06:21.875
-Yes, please.
-Thanks.

00:06:27.333 --> 00:06:29.833
Come with us to the winery in Nagano!

00:06:30.375 --> 00:06:34.875
Would I even be helpful though?

00:06:35.416 --> 00:06:38.583
Wait, where's the winery again?

00:06:39.333 --> 00:06:40.916
It's in Nagano.

00:06:41.833 --> 00:06:42.791
Nagano…

00:06:42.875 --> 00:06:44.666
I'm staying overnight in Nagano.

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:48.500
Oh…

00:07:15.833 --> 00:07:16.791
Hey.

00:07:16.875 --> 00:07:17.708
Oh.

00:07:18.666 --> 00:07:20.166
-You came, huh?
-Yeah.

00:07:20.791 --> 00:07:23.833
-Is it okay to park there?
-Yeah.

00:07:23.916 --> 00:07:25.083
-Really?
-Uh-huh.

00:07:28.583 --> 00:07:29.416
Hello.

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:33.416
I hope you don't mind me
tagging along to help.

00:07:36.333 --> 00:07:38.166
It's Hiro. Yay!

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:39.500
Thanks for having me.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Let's get going.

00:08:25.041 --> 00:08:26.500
What are you doing, Takuya?

00:08:28.208 --> 00:08:30.125
-Let's take a picture.
-Cuttings?

00:08:30.625 --> 00:08:31.458
Thirty stems?

00:08:32.458 --> 00:08:34.291
-Say cheese.
-Cheese!

00:08:57.958 --> 00:08:59.750
This place is beautiful.

00:09:00.416 --> 00:09:01.375
Right?

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.458
Way better than the photos.

00:09:07.666 --> 00:09:08.875
Um…

00:09:09.833 --> 00:09:10.666
Yes?

00:09:12.125 --> 00:09:13.083
I…

00:09:14.458 --> 00:09:18.083
need to apologize to you for something.

00:09:20.625 --> 00:09:21.583
What is it?

00:09:24.041 --> 00:09:24.958
I…

00:09:26.416 --> 00:09:29.500
stood you up twice.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.041
Hm?

00:09:31.125 --> 00:09:32.541
At Cielo.

00:09:33.375 --> 00:09:35.000
Oh.

00:09:36.291 --> 00:09:37.458
What?

00:09:38.916 --> 00:09:42.250
So you're the one
Chef Kenji wanted to set me up with?

00:09:42.791 --> 00:09:43.708
Yes.

00:09:46.791 --> 00:09:48.666
I see.

00:09:51.291 --> 00:09:52.541
Then…

00:09:54.791 --> 00:09:59.000
maybe we could've met sooner.

00:10:00.375 --> 00:10:02.833
Yes. Maybe.

00:10:11.875 --> 00:10:13.000
You make a good couple.

00:10:14.083 --> 00:10:15.708
No, no, no!

00:10:15.791 --> 00:10:17.750
We're not like that.

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:19.916
Is an office romance not allowed?

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.875
No, really, it's not like that.

00:10:21.958 --> 00:10:23.458
I already have a crush on…

00:10:25.083 --> 00:10:28.083
someone else.

00:10:28.166 --> 00:10:29.666
Hmm.

00:10:30.583 --> 00:10:31.750
You do?

00:10:32.666 --> 00:10:33.541
I'm…

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.666
an expert in unrequited love.

00:10:41.041 --> 00:10:42.916
An expert, huh?

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:47.375
Even if you really love someone,

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.916
if it's a burden to them,

00:10:52.125 --> 00:10:54.000
do you think it's better to let go?

00:10:57.791 --> 00:10:59.458
That's hard to say.

00:11:03.375 --> 00:11:07.916
Oh, but if it were that simple,

00:11:08.791 --> 00:11:12.166
no one would be stuck on
someone who doesn't love them back.

00:11:15.541 --> 00:11:16.958
You think so?

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:19.083
Uh-huh.

00:11:21.708 --> 00:11:22.625
But…

00:11:24.833 --> 00:11:27.666
when you fall for someone…

00:11:31.333 --> 00:11:36.000
You start caring about their feelings

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.708
and loving that part of them too.

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:41.333
Yeah.

00:11:41.416 --> 00:11:42.541
Oh, no!

00:11:46.458 --> 00:11:47.958
What's he doing?

00:11:49.208 --> 00:11:51.541
Oh, your coat.

00:11:52.416 --> 00:11:55.375
I still have it,
so if you want to pick it up…

00:11:55.458 --> 00:11:57.666
Oh, my coat.

00:11:59.708 --> 00:12:00.916
I forgot about that.

00:12:01.416 --> 00:12:07.625
This region has been dedicated
to growing grapes for 50 years.

00:12:08.125 --> 00:12:09.750
We had some challenges,

00:12:10.333 --> 00:12:14.541
but now we take pride in producing
higher-quality grapes than anywhere else.

00:12:15.791 --> 00:12:17.625
Our grapes

00:12:17.708 --> 00:12:22.000
are known for their distinct flavor
and rich aroma.

00:12:22.583 --> 00:12:24.958
They're used in many wines now

00:12:25.458 --> 00:12:28.708
thanks to everyone's wisdom and effort.

00:12:30.833 --> 00:12:35.208
A lavender-scented wine is rare, isn't it?

00:12:35.291 --> 00:12:36.291
Uh-huh.

00:12:36.375 --> 00:12:39.750
The label on this one
is scented with lavender.

00:12:40.416 --> 00:12:47.208
It's probably so you can enjoy the wine
and the scent of lavender together.

00:12:47.291 --> 00:12:48.458
-Really?
-Yes.

00:12:49.833 --> 00:12:50.916
Oh!

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.291
The scent and taste, huh?

00:12:54.791 --> 00:12:55.625
Oh.

00:12:56.375 --> 00:12:57.750
Two-way…

00:12:58.250 --> 00:12:59.333
Scent and taste?

00:12:59.416 --> 00:13:02.291
That's why it's called "Two-way"!
It's the nose and tongue.

00:13:02.375 --> 00:13:03.708
That's what it meant!

00:13:03.791 --> 00:13:05.916
-Not the eyes and tongue.
-Right!

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:12.083
But lately, the confiseries at the shop
don't really smell like lavender.

00:13:12.166 --> 00:13:13.916
Yeah, that's true.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.250
This year's lavender
has a much subtler scent.

00:13:18.333 --> 00:13:22.375
We'll need to find a way
to bring out the scent of lavender.

00:13:22.458 --> 00:13:24.208
Yeah, you're right.

00:13:25.125 --> 00:13:27.500
Excuse me! Can we get refills?

00:13:27.583 --> 00:13:28.458
Hey!

00:13:28.541 --> 00:13:30.541
This isn't an all-you-can-drink pub!

00:13:30.625 --> 00:13:32.458
-Sorry, he's fine.
-What's the harm?

00:13:32.541 --> 00:13:34.416
Everyone, there's free time after this.

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:37.791
Hey, Sosuke!

00:13:41.541 --> 00:13:45.000
You know, with Two-way Confiserie,

00:13:45.083 --> 00:13:49.625
you gotta feel it with your nose
and tongue, not your eyes and tongue.

00:13:49.708 --> 00:13:53.833
But my tongue's
not listening to me at all.

00:13:53.916 --> 00:13:54.875
What do I do?

00:13:54.958 --> 00:13:56.958
Chief, are you drunk?

00:13:57.041 --> 00:13:57.875
Yup!

00:13:57.958 --> 00:14:00.083
Sosuke!

00:14:01.833 --> 00:14:05.791
Seriously, it's bursting
with flavor and fragrance,

00:14:05.875 --> 00:14:10.083
like Nagano in June, right?

00:14:10.666 --> 00:14:13.791
-Don't you think, Mr. Takada?
-Uh-huh.

00:14:13.875 --> 00:14:17.875
All right! Time for the after-party!

00:14:17.958 --> 00:14:19.875
Let's go!

00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:21.375
Thanks for the wine!

00:14:21.458 --> 00:14:23.541
Thank you!

00:14:31.083 --> 00:14:32.416
Open sesame!

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:34.166
Open up!

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:36.875
-It's open.
-Thanks!

00:14:36.958 --> 00:14:38.458
Well done, indeed.

00:14:41.625 --> 00:14:43.833
Hey, since you've got the chance,

00:14:44.333 --> 00:14:46.041
why don’t you hang out together?

00:14:46.125 --> 00:14:46.958
Huh?

00:14:47.041 --> 00:14:48.708
I'll take everyone back.

00:14:49.708 --> 00:14:51.250
Okay, we're ready to go!

00:14:51.333 --> 00:14:53.125
W-Wait, what? Hey!

00:14:53.208 --> 00:14:54.208
-Hey.
-Hold on!

00:14:54.291 --> 00:14:56.125
Huh? Oh?

00:14:57.791 --> 00:15:00.750
Bye-bye, Sosuke!

00:15:11.833 --> 00:15:14.708
I knew it. Those two…

00:15:14.791 --> 00:15:16.291
Right?

00:15:16.375 --> 00:15:20.208
He always leaves the floor to me
and takes Hana with him.

00:15:20.291 --> 00:15:22.333
And she's always
looking only at the boss.

00:15:22.416 --> 00:15:23.416
-Right?
-Right?

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:25.041
Office romance, huh?

00:15:25.125 --> 00:15:27.083
Isn't it like a plot
from a romance series?

00:15:27.166 --> 00:15:31.666
The kind where they clash,
but slowly fall in love!

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:33.791
We can't be together!

00:15:33.875 --> 00:15:36.750
I’m the president from a wealthy family.

00:15:36.833 --> 00:15:40.375
And I'm just an ordinary employee!

00:15:46.791 --> 00:15:49.166
CONFERENCE IN NAGANO

00:15:50.625 --> 00:15:51.958
No taxis, huh?

00:15:54.875 --> 00:15:55.916
Um.

00:15:57.250 --> 00:16:00.708
There's somewhere I want to go.

00:16:01.333 --> 00:16:02.875
Will you come with me?

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:09.000
Wow! Isn't this place is amazing?

00:16:12.583 --> 00:16:14.166
-Welcome.
-Oh, hello!

00:16:14.708 --> 00:16:17.958
-We're from Le Sauveur.
-Le Sauveur. One moment, please.

00:16:18.041 --> 00:16:20.041
Um, I'm Motomi Kawamura.

00:16:20.125 --> 00:16:22.125
CONFERENCE 2024

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:35.625
Huh?

00:16:36.333 --> 00:16:37.333
Why?

00:16:38.333 --> 00:16:39.750
Hmm…

00:16:41.291 --> 00:16:42.250
Coincidence?

00:16:50.416 --> 00:16:51.791
Wow.

00:16:52.375 --> 00:16:54.458
What a lovely place.

00:16:55.458 --> 00:16:56.875
Amazing!

00:17:04.416 --> 00:17:05.250
Huh?

00:17:10.208 --> 00:17:11.208
No way.

00:17:12.166 --> 00:17:13.458
It's the same.

00:17:14.708 --> 00:17:16.000
How did you…?

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.791
I noticed it on your phone wallpaper.

00:17:20.708 --> 00:17:23.250
Sorry, I happened to see it.

00:17:30.625 --> 00:17:34.125
This photo is my dad's work.

00:17:36.416 --> 00:17:37.333
My dad

00:17:38.541 --> 00:17:42.125
was always traveling,
so he was hardly ever home.

00:17:42.625 --> 00:17:43.750
I barely saw him.

00:17:45.375 --> 00:17:46.833
But on my birthdays,

00:17:47.333 --> 00:17:52.250
he'd send me chocolate
from around the world.

00:17:52.833 --> 00:17:55.125
That made me so happy.

00:17:55.666 --> 00:18:00.208
I thought, "When I grow up,
I want to be someone who makes chocolate."

00:18:01.416 --> 00:18:04.750
Fathers are too shy
to say how they feel to their kids,

00:18:05.291 --> 00:18:08.583
so they use chocolate instead.

00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:11.291
My father was the same.

00:18:14.291 --> 00:18:16.083
Chocolate really is

00:18:16.666 --> 00:18:17.958
sarang.

00:18:18.583 --> 00:18:19.750
"Sarang"?

00:18:19.833 --> 00:18:20.666
Yeah.

00:18:21.333 --> 00:18:22.166
Sarang.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.041
"Sarang."

00:18:26.416 --> 00:18:27.500
Yeah.

00:18:29.208 --> 00:18:30.375
Oh.

00:18:30.458 --> 00:18:35.541
It's the feeling of wanting
to make the one you love even happier.

00:18:37.166 --> 00:18:38.000
Sarang?

00:18:39.875 --> 00:18:40.791
Sarang.

00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:48.458
You're finally looking at me

00:18:49.041 --> 00:18:51.416
without avoiding my eyes.

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:56.791
When did I ever avoid you?

00:18:56.875 --> 00:18:58.416
You're the one who did.

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:03.541
Are you

00:19:04.791 --> 00:19:05.916
okay now?

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:08.708
Is it

00:19:10.083 --> 00:19:11.750
still hard?

00:19:13.291 --> 00:19:14.125
No.

00:19:15.333 --> 00:19:16.333
Right now…

00:19:18.833 --> 00:19:20.458
I'm totally fine.

00:19:22.125 --> 00:19:26.000
Actually, I feel surprisingly refreshed.

00:19:26.666 --> 00:19:31.291
Someone like me
is better off alone after all.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.458
What do you mean, "someone like me"?

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.458
The Hana I've seen…

00:19:41.375 --> 00:19:43.250
Hmm…

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.916
She's a sincere employee
who pours her heart into her job

00:19:50.833 --> 00:19:55.041
and a kind person
who can truly comfort people.

00:19:57.916 --> 00:19:58.916
She has

00:19:59.666 --> 00:20:02.375
such a lovely smile.

00:20:03.125 --> 00:20:05.958
She's so adorable

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:11.875
that I end up smiling too,
without even realizing it.

00:20:12.625 --> 00:20:13.583
That's why

00:20:14.833 --> 00:20:16.250
I always want to see her.

00:20:18.875 --> 00:20:20.000
Huh?

00:20:21.583 --> 00:20:24.416
That said…

00:20:26.583 --> 00:20:28.875
she's kind of scary.

00:20:29.375 --> 00:20:30.208
What?

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.875
I'll try to cheer up.

00:20:40.666 --> 00:20:46.291
Thank you so much
for practicing with me all this time.

00:20:50.791 --> 00:20:51.916
So then,

00:20:52.958 --> 00:20:55.125
is our practice over?

00:20:55.708 --> 00:20:56.750
Yes.

00:20:56.833 --> 00:21:01.166
I don't need practice anymore.

00:21:05.166 --> 00:21:06.541
You're right.

00:21:19.291 --> 00:21:23.625
What do couples who meet
during the day do until night anyway?

00:21:23.708 --> 00:21:25.166
Without even drinking.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.125
Normally, it doesn't matter
if it's day or night.

00:21:31.291 --> 00:21:33.333
You meet when you want to.

00:21:34.041 --> 00:21:35.125
Hmm.

00:21:35.666 --> 00:21:36.791
Sounds boring.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.458
You know what?
I've been dying to try that.

00:21:43.875 --> 00:21:44.916
Can I?

00:21:48.166 --> 00:21:49.666
Huh? This?

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:50.625
Uh-huh.

00:21:59.291 --> 00:22:00.375
Wanna try?

00:22:12.083 --> 00:22:13.000
By the way,

00:22:14.333 --> 00:22:18.083
if you had to pick one,
which would you want?

00:22:18.166 --> 00:22:19.375
What?

00:22:20.125 --> 00:22:22.500
Well, I'm fine with any.

00:22:23.041 --> 00:22:24.208
Then this one?

00:22:26.916 --> 00:22:28.416
Give me your hand.

00:22:36.583 --> 00:22:37.875
-Huh?
-Nothing.

00:22:37.958 --> 00:22:39.416
Nothing's in there.

00:22:41.333 --> 00:22:42.250
Okay, then.

00:22:43.375 --> 00:22:44.208
Your hand.

00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:48.875
Oh, wow! Amazing!

00:22:48.958 --> 00:22:50.125
It's the one you wanted!

00:22:50.208 --> 00:22:51.416
Wait, how'd you do that?

00:22:52.375 --> 00:22:55.916
Anyway, this isn't my style.
I can't put it anywhere.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.666
It's pretty fun, isn't it?

00:22:59.333 --> 00:23:00.708
Meeting in the daytime.

00:23:01.291 --> 00:23:02.583
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

00:23:02.666 --> 00:23:04.791
Could you take our picture?

00:23:04.875 --> 00:23:06.375
-Sure.
-Thank you!

00:23:06.458 --> 00:23:09.000
-With that background, please.
-Of course.

00:23:10.958 --> 00:23:12.166
How should we pose?

00:23:13.458 --> 00:23:16.041
-Come on, that's embarrassing.
-Why? It's fine!

00:23:16.541 --> 00:23:18.583
Say cheese.

00:23:19.083 --> 00:23:20.583
-Okay.
-Thank you!

00:23:20.666 --> 00:23:21.833
-Thank you.
-Sure.

00:23:21.916 --> 00:23:23.708
Would you like me to take one?

00:23:24.375 --> 00:23:28.125
Oh, sure. Thanks.

00:23:29.333 --> 00:23:30.916
Come on, let's go!

00:23:34.041 --> 00:23:35.583
-Okay, ready?
-Yeah.

00:23:35.666 --> 00:23:36.666
Smile!

00:23:39.166 --> 00:23:41.375
Say cheese!

00:23:43.083 --> 00:23:45.291
Sorry about that.

00:23:48.416 --> 00:23:49.291
Wait.

00:23:49.375 --> 00:23:51.500
Seriously, I can't do this!

00:23:54.916 --> 00:23:55.875
Did I

00:23:57.250 --> 00:23:58.541
do something wrong?

00:24:00.208 --> 00:24:01.708
Like I said,

00:24:02.208 --> 00:24:05.416
I can't stand acting like a normal couple.

00:24:05.916 --> 00:24:07.375
It's annoying!

00:24:13.583 --> 00:24:16.291
I'm… sorry.

00:24:16.958 --> 00:24:18.375
Do you really

00:24:19.208 --> 00:24:20.416
hate me that much?

00:24:21.833 --> 00:24:23.208
"Hate"?

00:24:25.041 --> 00:24:28.041
I don't hate you.
That's what makes it worse.

00:24:29.458 --> 00:24:31.083
Don't follow me anymore.

00:24:46.416 --> 00:24:49.000
All right, fresh off the grill!

00:24:49.083 --> 00:24:50.250
Meat!

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.333
Thanks!

00:24:52.416 --> 00:24:53.291
Hey, newbie!

00:24:53.375 --> 00:24:55.166
Why are you drinking alone?

00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:56.666
Come join us!

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:59.000
Right! Oh, sorry.

00:24:59.083 --> 00:25:01.208
-Excuse me.
-It's more fun together!

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:04.666
-Good job, newbie.
-Oh, thank you.

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:06.250
You can hold your liquor!

00:25:08.625 --> 00:25:10.041
-Let's toast!
-Yeah!

00:25:10.125 --> 00:25:12.375
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

00:26:03.833 --> 00:26:05.041
Excuse me.

00:26:05.125 --> 00:26:05.958
Oh.

00:26:06.041 --> 00:26:08.750
Oh, hi there, Sosuke.

00:26:11.916 --> 00:26:13.166
Are you drunk?

00:26:13.833 --> 00:26:14.708
Nope.

00:26:21.333 --> 00:26:26.458
"I'm totally fine.
Actually, I feel refreshed," huh?

00:26:33.958 --> 00:26:35.083
This isn't your floor.

00:26:35.583 --> 00:26:36.833
Oh, sorry.

00:27:12.916 --> 00:27:14.375
Pull yourself together.

00:27:15.791 --> 00:27:16.625
Oh.

00:27:20.916 --> 00:27:22.416
Could this be

00:27:23.333 --> 00:27:24.458
love?

00:27:26.666 --> 00:27:28.375
Not love. Coffee.

00:27:29.166 --> 00:27:30.708
You're definitely drunk.

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:34.583
Why are you being so nice?

00:27:35.125 --> 00:27:38.083
Oh! Because I'm your employee.

00:27:38.666 --> 00:27:41.500
You said it's because
I'm your employee, right?

00:27:43.333 --> 00:27:46.333
Because I'm your employee, huh?

00:27:54.625 --> 00:27:56.875
Well then, good night.

00:27:56.958 --> 00:27:59.083
Good night.

00:27:59.666 --> 00:28:01.750
Good night!

00:28:07.791 --> 00:28:09.000
Wait.

00:28:19.625 --> 00:28:22.291
She's late. Should I call her?

00:28:22.375 --> 00:28:24.833
Don't you think you all
drank a bit too much?

00:28:26.083 --> 00:28:28.166
-Oh, there she is.
-I'm sorry!

00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:29.250
You're late!

00:28:29.333 --> 00:28:30.791
-Good morning.
-Morning.

00:28:30.875 --> 00:28:32.083
That's everyone, right?

00:28:32.166 --> 00:28:35.416
-No, Mr. Takada's not here.
-Hiro went home yesterday.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.333
Before we head back,

00:28:38.416 --> 00:28:40.833
we have one more important stop to make.

00:28:41.416 --> 00:28:42.541
-Huh?
-Important?

00:28:42.625 --> 00:28:43.583
Important stop?

00:28:44.125 --> 00:28:45.125
Important stop?

00:28:45.208 --> 00:28:46.875
-Where?
-Where are we going?

00:29:19.125 --> 00:29:20.166
-Mama!
-Mama!

00:29:21.833 --> 00:29:23.291
Wait, why?!

00:29:25.791 --> 00:29:30.000
It's been so long, everyone!
I can't believe you came all this way.

00:29:30.708 --> 00:29:33.166
I thought I'd never see you again.

00:29:35.625 --> 00:29:40.458
Thank you very much
for bringing everyone all this way.

00:29:42.875 --> 00:29:44.583
How have you been feeling?

00:29:44.666 --> 00:29:47.750
Thanks to the doctor you introduced me to,

00:29:47.833 --> 00:29:50.250
I've been getting the best treatment.

00:29:53.083 --> 00:29:56.791
But by next year,

00:29:56.875 --> 00:30:00.250
I might not be able to see
this beautiful view anymore.

00:30:01.041 --> 00:30:04.416
That's why I cherish
everything I can see now.

00:30:05.291 --> 00:30:08.250
I'm so glad I got to see your faces!

00:30:10.541 --> 00:30:12.291
Being here reminds me

00:30:13.166 --> 00:30:15.375
how wonderful my childhood was,

00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:18.541
how great my younger days were,

00:30:19.041 --> 00:30:22.500
and how lucky I was
to spend time with you all.

00:30:23.166 --> 00:30:28.000
I live each day thinking
my life's been pretty good overall.

00:30:28.541 --> 00:30:30.666
Even now, I'm having the best time!

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:32.916
I mean, look!

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.083
I get to wake up to this view every day.

00:30:36.166 --> 00:30:38.083
-Good point.
-The air's so fresh too!

00:30:38.166 --> 00:30:40.250
Right? Isn't it great?

00:30:50.541 --> 00:30:54.208
It's been a while,
Ms. Anonymous Chocolatier.

00:30:58.250 --> 00:31:01.000
I've seen you from behind a few times,

00:31:01.083 --> 00:31:03.833
and you've dropped by
as a customer too, right?

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:12.041
I told Chef Kenji
you can't stay anonymous forever.

00:31:14.166 --> 00:31:15.208
Right.

00:31:15.791 --> 00:31:17.791
They don't know yet?

00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:26.708
If you open up honestly,
I'm sure they'll understand.

00:31:27.666 --> 00:31:29.958
You know, life's too short,

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:34.916
even for just saying how you really feel.

00:31:55.416 --> 00:31:56.791
Done.

00:31:56.875 --> 00:31:58.416
-All set?
-Uh-huh.

00:31:59.750 --> 00:32:01.125
Can you bring everyone?

00:32:01.208 --> 00:32:02.250
Sure.

00:32:02.333 --> 00:32:03.375
Guys, taste test!

00:32:03.458 --> 00:32:04.958
-Got it.
-Okay.

00:32:05.041 --> 00:32:07.000
-Should I get the boss?
-Yes, please.

00:32:07.083 --> 00:32:07.916
Okay.

00:32:20.375 --> 00:32:21.208
It's good.

00:32:22.916 --> 00:32:24.416
Both the scent and taste.

00:32:26.083 --> 00:32:26.916
No.

00:32:27.458 --> 00:32:29.458
It's more than just "good."

00:32:30.916 --> 00:32:33.708
It's truly excellent.

00:32:40.666 --> 00:32:44.541
We came up with this thanks to our trip.

00:32:46.333 --> 00:32:49.000
Way to go, Hana! You noticed it.

00:32:49.958 --> 00:32:51.083
Good job!

00:33:01.541 --> 00:33:03.291
I heard from Takashi.

00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:09.500
You've figured out almost all of
Le Sauveur's ingredients and recipes.

00:33:10.208 --> 00:33:11.041
Yes.

00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:13.166
Sales are rising too.

00:33:13.791 --> 00:33:17.166
I'm planning to enter us
in the World Chocolatier Masters.

00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:21.375
I'd like to prove that ours
is the best chocolate in the world.

00:33:22.625 --> 00:33:24.041
There's no need for that.

00:33:25.625 --> 00:33:30.083
Use the information you've gathered
to proceed with our original plan.

00:33:31.083 --> 00:33:35.416
Once we've acquired their expertise
and learned all that we can,

00:33:35.916 --> 00:33:37.625
we have to shut the shop down.

00:33:38.458 --> 00:33:39.583
Shut it down?

00:33:39.666 --> 00:33:44.625
Going forward, Le Sauveur chocolate
will only be sold in convenience stores

00:33:46.375 --> 00:33:48.375
under Futago Confectionery's sales.

00:33:48.916 --> 00:33:51.500
Was that your plan all along?

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.500
Could you wait a little longer
before deciding?

00:33:55.583 --> 00:33:58.666
Le Sauveur is
the best chocolate shop in Japan.

00:33:59.458 --> 00:34:00.833
For Futago's future--

00:34:00.916 --> 00:34:01.791
Listen.

00:34:02.291 --> 00:34:06.541
Your idealism always ruins everything.

00:34:08.916 --> 00:34:10.958
Grow up a little.

00:34:24.125 --> 00:34:25.625
Dear Darth Vader,

00:34:26.666 --> 00:34:29.083
First, I owe you a deep apology.

00:34:30.083 --> 00:34:34.875
Our lives turned out to be
more entangled than I imagined.

00:34:35.375 --> 00:34:40.750
A series of unforeseen events
seems to have drawn us together.

00:34:41.875 --> 00:34:47.000
What's clear is that
I can't continue our counseling anymore.

00:34:48.166 --> 00:34:51.208
As a counselor who misjudged
the boundaries with my client,

00:34:51.291 --> 00:34:54.000
I have no right
to continue counseling you.

00:34:54.791 --> 00:34:57.500
But wherever I am,

00:34:57.583 --> 00:35:00.666
I'll be supporting your feelings.

00:35:01.416 --> 00:35:04.208
From your counselor, Irene.

00:35:04.958 --> 00:35:06.166
In the end,

00:35:07.416 --> 00:35:09.000
it's just not possible.

00:36:33.166 --> 00:36:34.791
I'm sorry.

00:36:35.291 --> 00:36:38.333
Did I interrupt you?

00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:44.333
Are you okay?

00:36:44.416 --> 00:36:46.625
Hiro! Are you all right?

00:36:46.708 --> 00:36:47.541
Huh?

00:36:49.625 --> 00:36:50.958
Hiro.

00:36:52.083 --> 00:36:52.916
I mean…

00:36:54.875 --> 00:36:56.833
Why did you come back here?

00:37:00.583 --> 00:37:01.541
I'll get some water.

00:37:01.625 --> 00:37:02.875
Hey, wait.

00:37:02.958 --> 00:37:03.916
Oh.

00:37:07.083 --> 00:37:08.083
I…

00:37:12.208 --> 00:37:14.416
don't want to be alone either.

00:37:26.166 --> 00:37:27.291
Stay with me.

00:37:31.208 --> 00:37:32.750
Like you did back then.

00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:38.541
SOSUKE FUJIWARA

00:42:12.208 --> 00:42:15.083
