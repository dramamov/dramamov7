00:00:11.291 --> 00:00:15.333
Ever since my mom passed away,
living abroad has been

00:00:15.416 --> 00:00:21.083
nothing but anxiety
for someone like me with scopophobia.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.791
There were so many days
when I couldn’t even laugh.

00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:29.791
But then,

00:00:31.083 --> 00:00:34.708
two years, three months, and 11 days ago…

00:00:48.958 --> 00:00:49.791
Whoa!

00:00:52.083 --> 00:00:53.708
Um, who are you? Huh?

00:01:07.708 --> 00:01:12.416
"Oh, maybe this is how I could go
to where my mom is."

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.291
The moment I thought that…

00:01:18.708 --> 00:01:21.208
That's dangerous. Be careful.

00:01:21.291 --> 00:01:23.291
TAKADA

00:01:25.083 --> 00:01:25.916
Hello?

00:01:36.416 --> 00:01:41.625
…I met the person who saved my life.

00:01:47.291 --> 00:01:49.958
Thanks to him, I started kendo,

00:01:50.041 --> 00:01:54.041
and getting active
helped lift my gloomy mood.

00:01:54.666 --> 00:01:56.000
So, Darth Vader,

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.416
was your mother the only one
you could look in the eye while talking?

00:02:01.083 --> 00:02:03.208
Yes, just my mom.

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:05.958
Wait!

00:02:06.791 --> 00:02:08.333
One more person, just recently.

00:02:08.416 --> 00:02:09.791
Oh, wonderful.

00:02:10.708 --> 00:02:15.208
If there's one more person in the world,
maybe there are others too.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.166
But I wonder why you were able
to look that person in the eye.

00:02:20.375 --> 00:02:21.583
Maybe

00:02:22.458 --> 00:02:27.041
my instincts warned me
he was a dangerous person.

00:02:27.541 --> 00:02:28.833
I see.

00:02:29.458 --> 00:02:30.541
But it's a shame.

00:02:30.625 --> 00:02:33.125
It would've been nice
if he were your dream guy.

00:02:33.208 --> 00:02:35.541
Nope. Definitely not my type.

00:02:35.625 --> 00:02:39.708
For the record, she wasn't my type at all.

00:02:40.208 --> 00:02:43.250
You slammed into her
hard enough to get injured,

00:02:43.333 --> 00:02:44.916
but you had no symptoms?

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.041
No.

00:02:46.916 --> 00:02:49.041
Nothing at all.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.750
That's never happened before.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.625
Hmm.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.458
Maybe I'll call it the "Miracle Touch."

00:02:58.541 --> 00:02:59.375
What?

00:02:59.458 --> 00:03:02.458
I mean, it's a miracle
you were fine with that person.

00:03:02.541 --> 00:03:04.208
"Miracle" is pushing it.

00:03:04.708 --> 00:03:06.708
More like a coincidence.

00:03:08.791 --> 00:03:12.750
It was probably just a one-time thing.

00:03:12.833 --> 00:03:14.125
But what a shame.

00:03:14.208 --> 00:03:17.750
It would've been nice
if she were your type.

00:03:38.208 --> 00:03:40.500
"Miracle Touch," huh?

00:03:56.416 --> 00:04:00.541
Excuse me, when will
Rainbow Palette be on sale again?

00:04:01.041 --> 00:04:02.666
I'm terribly sorry.

00:04:03.208 --> 00:04:08.375
Due to certain circumstances,
sales are suspended for the time being.

00:04:08.458 --> 00:04:10.125
Why can't you bring it back?

00:04:13.708 --> 00:04:14.666
I knew it.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.333
Oh.

00:04:16.416 --> 00:04:18.208
Is it because of the new management?

00:04:18.291 --> 00:04:19.541
No, um…

00:04:19.625 --> 00:04:21.458
Will it ever come back?

00:04:21.541 --> 00:04:23.625
-Please tell me.
-I'm so sorry.

00:04:23.708 --> 00:04:25.208
-Just tell me that.
-Excuse me.

00:04:28.041 --> 00:04:29.666
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.375
-Sorry.
-We apologize.

00:04:31.458 --> 00:04:33.458
-Sorry.
-It's all right.

00:04:33.541 --> 00:04:35.875
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

00:04:35.958 --> 00:04:39.166
-I'm so sorry.
-We're terribly sorry.

00:04:39.666 --> 00:04:40.833
I'm terribly sorry.

00:04:40.916 --> 00:04:44.041
It's fine, really. Don't worry about it.

00:04:44.125 --> 00:04:46.416
It's not fine at all.

00:04:47.541 --> 00:04:48.833
How many is that now?

00:04:50.041 --> 00:04:52.375
We make these for people to eat, you know.

00:04:58.458 --> 00:04:59.666
Are you listening?

00:05:00.583 --> 00:05:03.708
We pour all our hearts
into making these chocolates!

00:05:03.791 --> 00:05:05.583
We want lots of people to enjoy them.

00:05:05.666 --> 00:05:07.166
So stop wasting them.

00:05:32.666 --> 00:05:37.541
TRUFFLES YUZU

00:05:38.958 --> 00:05:42.166
"If possible, may I continue
delivering Pure Kenji chocolate

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.583
without meeting in person?"

00:05:44.666 --> 00:05:49.416
"It pains me to see
Rainbow Palette pulled from sale."

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.458
"From the Anonymous Chocolatier."

00:05:52.833 --> 00:05:55.000
They won't budge, huh?

00:05:56.166 --> 00:05:57.708
How will you respond?

00:05:58.916 --> 00:06:02.666
"We can't sell something without knowing

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:04.083
who made it."

00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.833
This is ridiculous!

00:06:16.333 --> 00:06:18.958
Don't contact me again
until Mama comes back!

00:06:19.041 --> 00:06:20.500
Sir, please calm down.

00:06:21.083 --> 00:06:23.750
We just met today.
Who do you think you are?!

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.750
You fired her because she was a problem
for Futago Confectionery, didn't you?

00:06:27.833 --> 00:06:30.541
-We just reopened.
-I'm sick of all this "we" talk!

00:06:30.625 --> 00:06:32.250
-Just today's delivery.
-Enough!

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:35.208
I knew this would happen.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:38.416
Losing Mama is a huge blow for us.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.750
He's furious the floor manager quit.

00:06:50.833 --> 00:06:53.083
He said he's done doing business with us.

00:06:55.083 --> 00:06:56.875
Seems like he's got the wrong idea.

00:06:57.375 --> 00:06:59.083
-Call him again.
-Okay.

00:07:02.666 --> 00:07:05.416
Kumayuzu…

00:07:06.916 --> 00:07:09.208
"A revolutionary in-house product,

00:07:09.291 --> 00:07:11.250
born from the Golden Fruit
hot spring inn."

00:07:12.041 --> 00:07:14.250
He's blocked our number.

00:07:14.875 --> 00:07:16.416
That's something else.

00:07:18.458 --> 00:07:19.458
Come in.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.166
You wanted to see me?

00:07:22.666 --> 00:07:25.833
Um, about Kumayuzu…

00:07:26.833 --> 00:07:29.083
They're an important supplier, right?

00:07:29.166 --> 00:07:30.541
Yes.

00:07:31.208 --> 00:07:36.125
Chef Kenji chose President Kuma's yuzu jam
from countless suppliers.

00:07:36.625 --> 00:07:40.291
Its level of sweetness
pairs perfectly with our chocolate.

00:07:40.375 --> 00:07:41.208
Hmm.

00:07:41.958 --> 00:07:43.000
How's our stock?

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:48.208
Since we didn't receive any today,
we only have enough for a few more days.

00:07:55.666 --> 00:07:57.083
Thank you.

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:08.708
Excuse me.

00:08:09.875 --> 00:08:12.083
This is delicious.

00:08:12.583 --> 00:08:14.458
How do you make them?

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:18.958
The secret to our Truffles Yuzu

00:08:19.041 --> 00:08:21.541
is in the yuzu jam production.

00:08:21.625 --> 00:08:23.250
During the jam-making process,

00:08:23.333 --> 00:08:26.916
the yuzu's distinctive bitterness
is mellowed with rock salt.

00:08:27.416 --> 00:08:32.416
That perfect balance brings out
the chocolate's sweetness.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:35.333
-They're good, aren't they?
-Absolutely!

00:08:35.416 --> 00:08:36.791
Enjoy.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.291
Ms. Lee Hana.

00:08:40.458 --> 00:08:43.000
When did you learn that explanation?

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:44.333
Oh.

00:08:46.166 --> 00:08:48.000
It's one of my favorite chocolates.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.916
Is that so?

00:08:52.125 --> 00:08:54.416
I'll leave the rest
of today's schedule to you.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.416
-Attend in my place.
-Huh?

00:08:56.916 --> 00:08:59.041
Let's go to Kumayuzu together.

00:08:59.125 --> 00:09:01.458
Me? But why?

00:09:02.083 --> 00:09:03.791
-Manager.
-Yes?

00:09:03.875 --> 00:09:06.500
Is it all right if she steps out?

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.208
Uh, yes. No problem at all.

00:09:10.875 --> 00:09:11.958
Thank you.

00:09:12.958 --> 00:09:13.916
Come on.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.916
Get ready, quickly.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.583
Huh? Okay.

00:09:18.333 --> 00:09:21.875
If someone's upset because of you,
you have to talk to them in person.

00:09:22.583 --> 00:09:24.625
He's a heart-over-logic kind of guy.

00:09:25.125 --> 00:09:26.916
And since his wife's Korean,

00:09:27.416 --> 00:09:31.333
I figured having another Korean there
might help our chances.

00:09:33.083 --> 00:09:35.625
But I can't drive, you know.

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:40.791
As you can see, neither can I.

00:09:49.458 --> 00:09:50.291
Hurry!

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:01.958
Why do I have to go?

00:10:03.708 --> 00:10:05.291
There you are, James Dean.

00:10:06.833 --> 00:10:08.916
What? I meant you look cool.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.875
No, actually, you almost made me blush.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.583
Sorry for suddenly calling you.

00:10:14.666 --> 00:10:15.500
No problem.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.625
Oh, she's one of our staff.

00:10:17.708 --> 00:10:19.916
She's Korean and works at our shop.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.250
Oh, really?

00:10:21.833 --> 00:10:23.041
Hi, I'm Hiro.

00:10:23.791 --> 00:10:25.250
Annyeonghaseyo?

00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:26.541
Wow.

00:10:26.625 --> 00:10:29.125
A-Annyeonghaseyo.

00:10:30.375 --> 00:10:31.875
Oh, nice to meet you.

00:10:32.375 --> 00:10:33.708
I'm Lee Hana.

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:37.750
He was my classmate in high school.
I asked him to drive us.

00:10:38.416 --> 00:10:39.875
So you're friends.

00:10:40.375 --> 00:10:42.708
He's smart, plays piano,
and is good at everything.

00:10:43.208 --> 00:10:44.791
We were in the kendo club too.

00:10:44.875 --> 00:10:47.791
Oh, so you've been doing kendo
since high school.

00:10:47.875 --> 00:10:49.541
-Yeah.
-Wow!

00:10:50.666 --> 00:10:53.458
Wait, why are we going to a hot spring?

00:10:53.541 --> 00:10:56.541
Oh, we've got a bit of a problem
at Le Sauveur.

00:10:56.625 --> 00:10:57.916
I'll explain on the way.

00:10:58.416 --> 00:11:00.583
I see. Got it.

00:11:00.666 --> 00:11:03.750
By the way, your Japanese is really good.

00:11:03.833 --> 00:11:06.583
No, I've still got a lot to learn.

00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:08.583
I've been in Japan for a while…

00:11:12.541 --> 00:11:13.666
What a rude guy.

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:14.625
Okay.

00:11:15.166 --> 00:11:16.666
What did you just say?

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:19.125
I said we should get going.

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:22.125
Thank you for driving.

00:11:22.708 --> 00:11:27.041
You were just saying,
"Why do I have to go?"

00:11:27.541 --> 00:11:29.333
Classic Hiro Effect.

00:11:29.416 --> 00:11:32.750
Why are women always only nice to you?

00:11:33.291 --> 00:11:34.291
Okay, let's go.

00:11:34.791 --> 00:11:35.791
Thanks.

00:11:36.291 --> 00:11:37.125
All right.

00:11:55.166 --> 00:11:56.041
Excuse me.

00:12:02.625 --> 00:12:03.583
Sorry to interrupt.

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:05.333
Oh!

00:12:06.208 --> 00:12:07.416
If you'd like.

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:09.583
Thank you.

00:12:11.375 --> 00:12:13.458
I bought a bunch of stuff.

00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:16.875
-Hang on.
-Oh, thank you.

00:12:16.958 --> 00:12:18.000
Here.

00:12:18.083 --> 00:12:19.250
Th-This is fine.

00:12:19.333 --> 00:12:21.708
-And this one's--
-Thank you.

00:12:23.791 --> 00:12:26.875
Do you like music, Hana?

00:12:29.666 --> 00:12:30.666
I do.

00:12:31.916 --> 00:12:32.791
Do you have

00:12:34.208 --> 00:12:38.375
a favorite genre or anything?

00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:40.000
Hmm.

00:12:42.625 --> 00:12:45.083
I like jazz.

00:12:45.166 --> 00:12:46.125
Oh?

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:52.000
Actually, I own a jazz bar
near Le Sauveur.

00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:56.291
Oh, wow! You do?

00:12:58.458 --> 00:13:01.041
People from Le Sauveur
drop by all the time.

00:13:02.041 --> 00:13:04.458
You should come by if you get the chance.

00:13:05.625 --> 00:13:07.916
I'd love to go to Bar Brush.

00:13:08.958 --> 00:13:10.708
We do live performances too.

00:13:12.458 --> 00:13:13.291
Wait.

00:13:14.541 --> 00:13:17.333
Did I tell you the name of the bar?

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:21.791
Let's hurry. We're short on time.

00:13:21.875 --> 00:13:22.708
Oh, sorry.

00:13:24.083 --> 00:13:25.125
Let's get in.

00:13:25.208 --> 00:13:26.041
Right!

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:38.500
KUMAYUZU HOT SPRINGS
GOLDEN FRUIT 1.8 KM AHEAD

00:13:38.583 --> 00:13:40.541
In Kumayuzu's yuzu jam,

00:13:40.625 --> 00:13:43.750
the yuzu's distinctive bitterness
is mellowed with rock salt.

00:13:44.541 --> 00:13:46.583
That perfect balance

00:13:47.083 --> 00:13:50.000
brings out the chocolate's sweetness.

00:13:51.125 --> 00:13:54.541
It's key to Le Sauveur's Truffles Yuzu.

00:13:55.083 --> 00:13:57.958
-How was that?
-Yeah, I think it sounds good.

00:13:58.541 --> 00:14:00.541
I'm so smart, after all.

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:02.541
So annoying.

00:14:02.625 --> 00:14:04.625
What does that Korean mean?

00:14:04.708 --> 00:14:05.833
Was it an insult?

00:14:05.916 --> 00:14:08.208
No, not at all!

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.333
You've got sharp ears.

00:14:13.916 --> 00:14:17.333
If everything goes well,
I have a favor to ask.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:18.833
Yes?

00:14:19.958 --> 00:14:22.416
Please shake hands with him for me.

00:14:23.166 --> 00:14:25.416
My hand's like this, so I can't.

00:14:25.916 --> 00:14:28.125
But you still have the other hand.

00:14:28.791 --> 00:14:30.583
Whose fault was it that I got hurt?

00:14:30.666 --> 00:14:31.500
Huh?

00:14:32.916 --> 00:14:35.791
It's a bit complicated.

00:14:36.291 --> 00:14:37.625
Could you help him out?

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:39.833
Yes.

00:14:40.583 --> 00:14:41.791
Of course.

00:14:45.541 --> 00:14:46.750
Seriously?

00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:49.666
I'm pretty sure it's around here.

00:14:50.916 --> 00:14:51.750
Oh?

00:14:51.833 --> 00:14:52.833
Hmm?

00:15:01.125 --> 00:15:02.541
Is it the tire?

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.666
Ugh. Damn it!

00:15:12.166 --> 00:15:13.458
Yeah, it's the tire.

00:15:14.041 --> 00:15:15.833
Damn!

00:15:17.375 --> 00:15:19.166
Hey, do you have a spare?

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:20.791
Check the trunk.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.500
Do you need any help?

00:15:27.583 --> 00:15:29.291
No, I've got it.

00:15:29.791 --> 00:15:31.083
Ms. Lee Hana!

00:15:31.166 --> 00:15:33.166
Sorry, can you give me a hand?

00:15:33.833 --> 00:15:34.666
What?

00:15:36.708 --> 00:15:39.125
Sorry, could you tie this for me?

00:15:39.208 --> 00:15:40.125
Thanks.

00:15:42.166 --> 00:15:44.041
Is it under the tools?

00:15:44.125 --> 00:15:45.375
Huh? Hang on.

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:47.250
This one too, please.

00:15:48.583 --> 00:15:50.416
-It won't open.
-Huh?

00:15:51.208 --> 00:15:52.916
Well, if it isn't Cinderella!

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.166
I'm coming.

00:15:54.708 --> 00:15:57.000
-Okay, good.
-Oh, that bear logo!

00:15:59.125 --> 00:16:00.125
Let's hurry.

00:16:01.583 --> 00:16:03.791
I've got this. You two go on ahead.

00:16:04.291 --> 00:16:05.291
Appreciate it.

00:16:05.375 --> 00:16:07.166
Ms. Lee Hana, hold out your hands.

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:08.416
My hands?

00:16:09.916 --> 00:16:11.125
Grab my bag and follow me.

00:16:11.208 --> 00:16:13.000
Come on, let's go!

00:16:13.083 --> 00:16:15.958
Ugh, this is the worst!

00:16:17.125 --> 00:16:20.458
Carry your own bag!

00:16:20.541 --> 00:16:22.500
Oh, my bag!

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:25.375
Hurry!

00:16:33.583 --> 00:16:36.291
Whoa!

00:16:36.375 --> 00:16:37.791
That scared me!

00:16:37.875 --> 00:16:41.208
H-Hey! No, no, no!

00:16:47.916 --> 00:16:49.208
Sorry.

00:16:56.791 --> 00:16:57.625
Hana.

00:16:58.208 --> 00:16:59.208
Here.

00:17:15.541 --> 00:17:16.541
No, it's no good!

00:17:32.541 --> 00:17:33.500
Are you okay?

00:17:34.166 --> 00:17:35.833
-Your bag.
-Oh, right.

00:17:39.916 --> 00:17:40.916
Are you hurt?

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.041
No, I'm okay. Thank you.

00:17:44.625 --> 00:17:46.166
I'm glad you're okay.

00:17:46.958 --> 00:17:48.958
-How did this happen?
-Let's go!

00:17:49.041 --> 00:17:49.875
Huh?

00:17:50.583 --> 00:17:52.791
-Ms. Lee Hana!
-Y-Yes!

00:17:52.875 --> 00:17:54.166
Thank you so much!

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:56.000
Take care of the car!

00:18:05.708 --> 00:18:06.625
Hello.

00:18:06.708 --> 00:18:09.958
I'm here to see President Kuma.

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.541
I'm from Le Sauveur, one of your partners.

00:18:12.625 --> 00:18:15.250
Oh? Didn't you see him at the shop?

00:18:15.333 --> 00:18:16.583
Well…

00:18:18.416 --> 00:18:19.750
Um…

00:18:19.833 --> 00:18:23.375
You're from Korea, right?

00:18:23.458 --> 00:18:24.791
Oh, yes.

00:18:24.875 --> 00:18:25.750
That's right.

00:18:28.333 --> 00:18:29.166
Oh.

00:18:30.291 --> 00:18:31.875
So, you're Korean.

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:36.708
Oh my. How nice! You speak Korean?

00:18:37.291 --> 00:18:38.541
I'm Korean.

00:18:38.625 --> 00:18:42.083
You are? What a pleasure to meet you.

00:18:42.166 --> 00:18:44.250
What brings you here to see my husband?

00:18:44.333 --> 00:18:45.166
Oh.

00:18:45.666 --> 00:18:50.916
Our shop is in urgent need
of your yuzu jam.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.041
Could we speak with the president?

00:18:53.125 --> 00:18:56.625
Oh, I see. Just a moment, please.

00:18:57.375 --> 00:19:01.791
My husband's always running around,
east and west.

00:19:03.416 --> 00:19:05.291
Oh, hello?

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.208
We have guests here
from one of our business partners.

00:19:10.791 --> 00:19:11.958
Okay.

00:19:12.041 --> 00:19:15.166
I understand. Drive safe, okay?

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.291
I'm sorry.

00:19:18.375 --> 00:19:20.125
He might be a little late.

00:19:20.208 --> 00:19:22.125
He asked if you could wait.

00:19:22.208 --> 00:19:23.416
Is that all right?

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:24.916
Yes, of course.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.083
We're happy to wait until he gets back.

00:19:28.166 --> 00:19:30.916
Thank you. Please, come in.

00:19:31.541 --> 00:19:33.875
-Excuse me.
-Yes, come in.

00:19:34.458 --> 00:19:35.750
Hello.

00:19:35.833 --> 00:19:36.791
He's with us.

00:19:36.875 --> 00:19:40.041
Oh, I see. Please, come on in.

00:19:40.125 --> 00:19:41.541
Right this way.

00:19:41.625 --> 00:19:43.291
Thank you.

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:49.958
Please head inside.

00:19:50.041 --> 00:19:51.958
-Excuse me.
-Yes, go ahead.

00:19:52.458 --> 00:19:53.375
Please.

00:19:54.833 --> 00:19:56.041
Please, go on in.

00:19:56.125 --> 00:19:58.166
-Thank you.
-Of course.

00:19:59.291 --> 00:20:04.333
Well then, I'll let you know
as soon as my husband returns.

00:20:04.416 --> 00:20:06.416
-Thank you.
-Please enjoy your time.

00:20:07.541 --> 00:20:10.958
Maybe I'll wait in the car
since I'm not really involved.

00:20:11.041 --> 00:20:13.958
No, stay. It'd be awkward
if it's just the two of us.

00:20:14.458 --> 00:20:17.166
Th-Then I'll go wait in the car.

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:18.958
You've got work to do.

00:20:19.916 --> 00:20:22.041
Sorry, I need to go wash my hands.

00:20:32.375 --> 00:20:37.125
I guess I'll go take a stroll then.

00:20:58.166 --> 00:20:59.000
Um…

00:21:00.041 --> 00:21:00.875
Oh.

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:14.458
Once,

00:21:15.875 --> 00:21:19.750
when Chef Kenji was still alive,
he asked me for a favor.

00:21:20.625 --> 00:21:22.041
It was

00:21:23.083 --> 00:21:26.666
kind of a strange request, actually.

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:29.000
A request?

00:21:29.083 --> 00:21:29.916
Yeah.

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:34.708
It was like a surprise gift or something.

00:21:35.541 --> 00:21:39.833
He was trying to set me up with someone.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.791
But I ended up running late,

00:21:45.458 --> 00:21:47.416
so I never got to meet them.

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:51.041
No, it's not because you were late.

00:21:52.583 --> 00:21:56.500
I don't think you need to feel bad
about something so small.

00:21:56.583 --> 00:21:59.500
Chef would scold you if he heard that.

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:04.750
He was… a really kind person.

00:22:06.708 --> 00:22:09.875
-Did you know Kenji personally?
-Oh!

00:22:10.416 --> 00:22:14.208
It's just, everyone said that about him.

00:22:14.708 --> 00:22:15.541
I see.

00:22:16.875 --> 00:22:18.458
That's true.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.041
Yes.

00:22:21.333 --> 00:22:23.416
He really was kind.

00:22:32.125 --> 00:22:34.833
I knew you were a good person too.

00:22:35.333 --> 00:22:36.166
Hm?

00:22:45.250 --> 00:22:46.125
Um.

00:22:46.791 --> 00:22:47.625
Yes?

00:22:50.250 --> 00:22:52.041
I have something to tell you.

00:22:55.208 --> 00:22:56.041
Okay.

00:23:00.125 --> 00:23:01.291
I…

00:23:03.166 --> 00:23:04.291
Um…

00:23:07.375 --> 00:23:08.208
Yes?

00:23:08.833 --> 00:23:09.833
So, uh…

00:23:16.541 --> 00:23:18.458
I've always liked--

00:23:18.541 --> 00:23:20.458
Sorry, excuse me.

00:23:22.916 --> 00:23:24.958
BETTER NOT ANSWER

00:23:26.541 --> 00:23:27.375
Hello?

00:23:27.458 --> 00:23:29.041
What the heck is this?!

00:23:29.125 --> 00:23:31.166
It's just water!

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:32.541
-What?
-I can't drink this!

00:23:35.541 --> 00:23:36.666
Sorry about that.

00:23:37.916 --> 00:23:38.916
You were saying?

00:23:39.875 --> 00:23:41.375
What I wanted to say was--

00:23:41.458 --> 00:23:43.166
You said you liked something?

00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:44.500
Rock music!

00:23:44.583 --> 00:23:48.416
-Rock?
-I actually like rock, not jazz.

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:51.250
-It's rock.
-Oh, sorry again!

00:23:51.333 --> 00:23:53.333
I got another call.

00:23:53.833 --> 00:23:55.416
-Sorry.
-I-It's okay.

00:24:00.333 --> 00:24:02.208
-I'm fine!
-Are you okay, ma'am?

00:24:02.291 --> 00:24:03.208
Can you stand?

00:24:03.291 --> 00:24:05.000
-Hello?
-Nope!

00:24:05.083 --> 00:24:06.791
-Sorry.
-Hello?

00:24:06.875 --> 00:24:09.000
-Are you okay?
-Let's drink, mister!

00:24:09.708 --> 00:24:10.750
Hello?

00:24:12.125 --> 00:24:14.875
Is this Mr. "Don't Ever Call"?

00:24:16.125 --> 00:24:18.666
Uh, I'm at Bar Brush right now.

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:19.583
Your friend…

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:22.000
Wait, barkeep?

00:24:24.583 --> 00:24:28.666
You better not tell him I said
I wanna see him, okay?!

00:24:29.166 --> 00:24:31.666
She says not to tell you
she wants to see you.

00:24:32.708 --> 00:24:33.833
Got it.

00:24:34.958 --> 00:24:37.916
Okay, I'll head back now.

00:24:41.041 --> 00:24:41.958
Yeah, okay.

00:24:53.541 --> 00:24:55.666
Sorry for leaving before you guys.

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:57.000
Oh no, not at all.

00:24:57.083 --> 00:24:59.208
Thank you for all your help.

00:24:59.291 --> 00:25:01.041
Thanks. I owe you one.

00:25:01.791 --> 00:25:03.083
Okay.

00:25:03.166 --> 00:25:04.666
I'll be off then.

00:25:05.333 --> 00:25:06.625
See you, Hana.

00:25:06.708 --> 00:25:08.208
-Take care.
-Yeah.

00:25:08.708 --> 00:25:09.541
See you.

00:25:28.166 --> 00:25:31.458
IN THAT CASE, I'M AFRAID TO INFORM YOU

00:25:31.541 --> 00:25:35.583
WE CANNOT CONTINUE THIS CONTRACT WITH YOU

00:27:22.583 --> 00:27:24.208
Oh, um…

00:27:26.041 --> 00:27:27.416
Darn bug…

00:27:31.916 --> 00:27:33.958
He's taking a while.

00:27:58.458 --> 00:28:00.125
Welcome back!

00:28:01.875 --> 00:28:05.166
Sorry to keep you waiting.
My husband's back!

00:28:05.666 --> 00:28:06.500
Okay.

00:28:13.833 --> 00:28:16.458
Are you the new president of Le Sauveur?

00:28:16.541 --> 00:28:17.875
From Futago Confectionery?

00:28:18.916 --> 00:28:21.083
That's you, isn't it?

00:28:23.208 --> 00:28:24.125
Yes.

00:28:24.708 --> 00:28:26.958
Um…

00:28:27.041 --> 00:28:29.041
You waited all this time
without even eating?

00:28:30.541 --> 00:28:31.916
Come, this way.

00:28:33.958 --> 00:28:37.083
Come, please. Right this way.

00:28:59.916 --> 00:29:02.333
In Kumayuzu's yuzu jam,

00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:07.458
the yuzu's natural bitterness is, uh…

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.958
Rock salt. Mellowed with rock salt.

00:29:12.041 --> 00:29:14.291
Right! With rock salt--

00:29:14.375 --> 00:29:17.541
I'm so sorry! Forgive me!

00:29:17.625 --> 00:29:20.333
I made you come all this way!

00:29:21.375 --> 00:29:23.125
I rushed over to Mama's place,

00:29:23.208 --> 00:29:27.458
and she yelled at me
for not delivering the yuzu jam.

00:29:28.291 --> 00:29:30.833
She's scary when she gets mad, huh?

00:29:32.875 --> 00:29:33.791
The truth is,

00:29:34.541 --> 00:29:36.750
when I heard Mama had quit,

00:29:36.833 --> 00:29:40.083
I figured that an arrogant
and entitled new president

00:29:40.583 --> 00:29:45.500
from Futago Confectionery
had forced her to leave.

00:29:46.291 --> 00:29:47.916
I couldn't forgive that.

00:29:50.416 --> 00:29:51.708
But I was wrong.

00:29:53.541 --> 00:29:54.958
She told me herself.

00:29:56.083 --> 00:29:57.333
It's her eyes, right?

00:29:58.208 --> 00:30:00.083
Diabetic retinopathy.

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:02.500
It's developed, hasn't it?

00:30:05.291 --> 00:30:09.625
She said she's going back to her hometown
in Nagano to focus on her treatment.

00:30:10.291 --> 00:30:12.500
You paid her retirement
and medical expenses.

00:30:13.541 --> 00:30:17.250
And even introduced her
to a top university hospital doctor.

00:30:19.083 --> 00:30:23.708
You really went above and beyond for her.

00:30:24.208 --> 00:30:28.125
I'm so grateful,
from the bottom of my heart!

00:30:28.208 --> 00:30:29.625
No, uh…

00:30:30.125 --> 00:30:32.791
I didn't do anything special.

00:30:32.875 --> 00:30:34.458
We did what any company would--

00:30:34.541 --> 00:30:35.541
No!

00:30:36.208 --> 00:30:38.083
Most people wouldn't go that far.

00:31:04.333 --> 00:31:05.375
Oh, no.

00:31:08.333 --> 00:31:09.583
Huh? What?

00:31:12.416 --> 00:31:13.250
Hmm?

00:31:18.875 --> 00:31:19.708
Yes?

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:22.083
The shirt in your bag?

00:31:22.166 --> 00:31:23.000
Huh?

00:31:25.666 --> 00:31:27.583
Excuse me for a moment.

00:31:28.375 --> 00:31:29.208
Huh?

00:31:30.416 --> 00:31:31.375
What's going on?

00:31:38.541 --> 00:31:40.875
I brought the shirt you asked for.

00:31:40.958 --> 00:31:42.125
Whoa!

00:31:43.375 --> 00:31:45.166
Why are you half-naked?

00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:46.208
This isn't it.

00:31:46.291 --> 00:31:48.125
You said you wanted a clean shirt.

00:31:48.208 --> 00:31:49.541
This isn't clean.

00:31:49.625 --> 00:31:50.833
They all looked the same!

00:31:50.916 --> 00:31:53.541
That's why I told you
to bring the whole bag.

00:31:53.625 --> 00:31:55.333
Hurry and go get it!

00:31:57.083 --> 00:31:58.916
What a creep.

00:32:06.708 --> 00:32:08.708
What do I do?

00:32:12.375 --> 00:32:13.208
Oh!

00:32:18.791 --> 00:32:20.791
There's no time. Just wear this!

00:32:20.875 --> 00:32:22.708
I can't wear this!

00:32:22.791 --> 00:32:25.291
Why do you have to change
now of all times?

00:32:25.375 --> 00:32:26.416
Because…

00:32:29.166 --> 00:32:30.583
I told you it's complicated.

00:32:30.666 --> 00:32:33.041
I don't even know why it's complicated.

00:32:33.125 --> 00:32:34.958
What do you expect me to do?

00:32:35.041 --> 00:32:36.833
I don't need to share my secret.

00:32:36.916 --> 00:32:38.541
I don't wanna hear it anyway.

00:32:38.625 --> 00:32:39.541
That's enough!

00:32:40.208 --> 00:32:41.125
I'm done.

00:32:43.208 --> 00:32:45.208
I can't wear this.

00:32:45.291 --> 00:32:47.708
No manners at all!

00:32:58.750 --> 00:33:01.666
He'll be back soon,
so please wait a bit longer.

00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:02.958
Oh, okay.

00:33:13.125 --> 00:33:14.666
What's the matter?

00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:16.375
My apologies, Mr. Kuma.

00:33:16.458 --> 00:33:17.583
Not at all.

00:33:17.666 --> 00:33:20.000
My shirt got a little dirty.

00:33:20.083 --> 00:33:22.625
Oh, is that all?

00:33:22.708 --> 00:33:27.666
I was so worried
I'd done something to upset you.

00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:29.000
Oh no, of course not.

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:32.166
We just refreshed the hot spring water.

00:33:32.250 --> 00:33:35.791
Why not take a soak
and relax after dinner?

00:33:37.666 --> 00:33:39.041
Are you sure?

00:33:40.291 --> 00:33:41.208
Yes.

00:33:46.958 --> 00:33:49.333
I want to tell you how I feel

00:33:49.916 --> 00:33:52.541
But when you're near

00:33:53.125 --> 00:33:56.333
I can't say a word

00:33:56.416 --> 00:33:59.208
I really hate that about myself

00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:02.916
I need to be brave

00:34:03.416 --> 00:34:06.375
So I won't have regrets

00:34:07.375 --> 00:34:13.958
Little by little, I'll get closer to you

00:34:14.041 --> 00:34:15.791
-And I'll--
-Ms. Lee Hana?

00:34:19.708 --> 00:34:21.125
What song is that?

00:34:23.083 --> 00:34:24.291
Is it a Korean song?

00:34:29.041 --> 00:34:30.500
It's a good song.

00:34:33.083 --> 00:34:34.625
What's it called?

00:34:39.208 --> 00:34:40.375
It's a secret.

00:34:43.416 --> 00:34:45.333
Sorry for interrupting.

00:34:46.041 --> 00:34:47.541
Please, go on.

00:34:48.333 --> 00:34:50.208
How could I?

00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:55.750
Why…

00:34:57.416 --> 00:34:59.250
didn't you tell me?

00:35:00.083 --> 00:35:00.958
Huh?

00:35:01.458 --> 00:35:02.666
Tell you what?

00:35:04.083 --> 00:35:07.958
The reason Mama quit.

00:35:13.208 --> 00:35:16.416
There were all sorts
of rumors going around.

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:20.833
That's because…

00:35:25.291 --> 00:35:27.875
I don't want anyone to worry.

00:35:28.541 --> 00:35:29.666
Can you…

00:35:31.541 --> 00:35:32.833
keep it between us?

00:35:33.708 --> 00:35:34.916
Please, sir.

00:35:38.583 --> 00:35:39.583
Okay.

00:35:39.666 --> 00:35:41.000
RESIGNATION LETTER

00:35:41.083 --> 00:35:45.708
She said she didn't want
anyone to know the real reason.

00:35:49.041 --> 00:35:50.875
Is it really that important?

00:35:54.625 --> 00:36:01.208
But in the end,
you kept her secret, didn't you?

00:36:03.375 --> 00:36:05.958
I'm sure she appreciates that.

00:36:08.791 --> 00:36:10.416
You think so?

00:36:12.291 --> 00:36:13.833
I'm the same.

00:36:14.875 --> 00:36:17.500
We all have secrets.

00:36:19.208 --> 00:36:21.541
Things we'd rather hide,

00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:24.541
or if possible…

00:36:26.583 --> 00:36:30.291
things we never want anyone
to find out about.

00:36:33.875 --> 00:36:36.458
Do you have a secret like that?

00:36:39.708 --> 00:36:41.208
Oh, never mind.

00:36:41.291 --> 00:36:42.958
You don't have to answer.

00:36:43.666 --> 00:36:46.750
If it were easy to say,
then it wouldn't be a secret.

00:36:48.083 --> 00:36:48.916
Yeah.

00:37:27.458 --> 00:37:29.291
Dear Anonymous Chocolatier,

00:37:30.708 --> 00:37:32.125
I've had a change of heart.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.583
I'd like to keep things as they are.

00:37:36.083 --> 00:37:38.833
Please keep delivering
the chocolates as usual.

00:37:40.916 --> 00:37:45.458
I understand you may have
reasons you cannot share.

00:37:46.666 --> 00:37:48.375
I was being inconsiderate.

00:37:49.708 --> 00:37:52.250
I'd like to bring back Rainbow Palette.

00:37:58.166 --> 00:37:59.750
Therefore,

00:38:00.583 --> 00:38:03.750
please resume deliveries
starting tomorrow morning.

00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:05.083
Huh?

00:38:05.666 --> 00:38:06.666
Tomorrow?!

00:38:08.583 --> 00:38:09.666
What's wrong?

00:38:13.375 --> 00:38:14.375
Are you okay?

00:38:14.875 --> 00:38:17.041
No, not at all!

00:38:17.583 --> 00:38:18.666
Ugh!

00:38:23.833 --> 00:38:25.125
Once again…

00:38:29.541 --> 00:38:31.333
Thank you so much!

00:38:32.625 --> 00:38:34.958
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:38:35.041 --> 00:38:35.875
Well then.

00:38:36.416 --> 00:38:37.666
We'll be going now.

00:38:38.166 --> 00:38:40.333
-Take care.
-Safe travels.

00:38:41.708 --> 00:38:43.083
Take care.

00:38:43.166 --> 00:38:44.250
Thank you.

00:38:44.333 --> 00:38:45.416
Please come again.

00:38:46.375 --> 00:38:47.625
I will.

00:38:51.333 --> 00:38:52.875
C-Can I sit in the front?

00:38:52.958 --> 00:38:54.000
Yes, go ahead.

00:38:54.083 --> 00:38:55.083
Wait.

00:38:56.916 --> 00:38:58.916
Could you wrap this around your shoes?

00:38:59.000 --> 00:38:59.833
Excuse me?

00:38:59.916 --> 00:39:02.541
I don't want you getting in
with those shoes.

00:39:04.333 --> 00:39:05.500
Please.

00:39:05.583 --> 00:39:06.416
Okay.

00:39:12.375 --> 00:39:13.833
What a jerk.

00:39:15.416 --> 00:39:16.833
Of course.

00:39:26.541 --> 00:39:29.291
What urgent business
do you have at this hour?

00:39:30.125 --> 00:39:32.416
It's your fault, you bastard.

00:39:34.375 --> 00:39:36.666
Another insult? Please stop that.

00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:38.958
No, no. You've got it wrong.

00:39:41.291 --> 00:39:42.625
Oh, by the way,

00:39:43.125 --> 00:39:45.166
I emailed
the Anonymous Chocolatier earlier.

00:39:46.166 --> 00:39:47.041
Oh?

00:39:47.958 --> 00:39:53.166
Since Rainbow Palette goes back
on sale tomorrow, and it's the weekend,

00:39:53.250 --> 00:39:55.791
many customers must be
looking forward to it, right?

00:39:56.458 --> 00:39:58.916
So I doubled the order.

00:40:00.208 --> 00:40:01.791
Isn't that a good idea?

00:40:04.291 --> 00:40:05.125
Yes.

00:40:08.666 --> 00:40:10.791
Honestly, what should I do
with this ssagaji?

00:40:10.875 --> 00:40:13.041
I told you, stop insulting me.

00:40:13.125 --> 00:40:13.958
No, no.

00:40:14.041 --> 00:40:17.916
I said you're amazing,
and an absolute genius.

00:40:18.416 --> 00:40:21.166
-Yup.
-Liar. You definitely didn't say that.

00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:24.250
-What was that? Ssagaji?
-Huh?

00:40:24.333 --> 00:40:25.583
-Ssagaji?
-What?

00:40:25.666 --> 00:40:27.416
No, I didn't say that.

00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:28.541
Huh?

00:40:28.625 --> 00:40:30.666
I said you're a genius.

00:40:38.583 --> 00:40:41.125
Can I ask you something?

00:40:42.875 --> 00:40:45.125
Why do you avoid
making eye contact with people?

00:40:49.833 --> 00:40:50.916
That's…

00:40:53.333 --> 00:40:55.083
my secret.

00:40:57.791 --> 00:40:58.625
I see.

00:41:00.583 --> 00:41:01.750
Then

00:41:02.333 --> 00:41:04.666
why is it you can look me in the eye?

00:41:06.583 --> 00:41:08.125
Like this.

00:42:01.416 --> 00:42:02.666
Don't go.

00:42:05.833 --> 00:42:07.333
Stay with me.

00:42:09.416 --> 00:42:11.041
Like you did back then.

00:42:32.333 --> 00:42:34.291
Oh, I'll get off here.

00:42:34.375 --> 00:42:37.416
Huh? Aren't you in a hurry?
I can drive you home.

00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:38.791
It's fine.

00:42:39.833 --> 00:42:40.875
All right.

00:42:55.583 --> 00:42:56.541
Wait.

00:43:06.041 --> 00:43:07.250
Um.

00:43:10.041 --> 00:43:10.875
Could I…

00:43:12.875 --> 00:43:14.458
shake your hand?

00:43:17.083 --> 00:43:17.916
Hm?

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:19.958
Oh, uh,

00:43:20.041 --> 00:43:23.416
just to say thank you
for everything today.

00:43:28.375 --> 00:43:30.791
Sure. I don't mind.

00:43:38.291 --> 00:43:39.291
Thank you…

00:43:42.166 --> 00:43:43.125
so much

00:43:44.250 --> 00:43:45.833
for everything today.

00:44:49.916 --> 00:44:50.750
Huh?

00:44:52.250 --> 00:44:55.083
Wait. Are you crying?

00:44:56.208 --> 00:44:58.916
What? No! Why would I cry?

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.583
You were squeezing my hand too hard.

00:45:02.458 --> 00:45:03.750
How strong are you?

00:45:03.833 --> 00:45:06.125
I thought you were going
to hurt my hand again.

00:45:06.625 --> 00:45:07.458
Wow.

00:45:11.875 --> 00:45:13.500
I didn't know

00:45:14.708 --> 00:45:18.666
tears could well up like that,
all at once.

00:45:20.791 --> 00:45:22.500
I've never seen that before.

00:45:27.208 --> 00:45:28.375
Come on.

00:45:28.875 --> 00:45:30.500
You're the one tearing up now.

00:45:32.875 --> 00:45:33.708
Oh.

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:35.416
That's because

00:45:36.250 --> 00:45:38.333
you looked sad first.

00:45:38.416 --> 00:45:40.583
You don't need to be sad with me.

00:45:40.666 --> 00:45:42.916
This is all new for me too--

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:43.875
Anyway…

00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:50.375
I'm heading home.

00:46:06.791 --> 00:46:09.333
Maybe he's not such a bad guy?

00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:22.500
So warm.

00:50:12.041 --> 00:50:14.875
