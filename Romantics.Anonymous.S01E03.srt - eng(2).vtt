Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org

00:00:23.583 --> 00:00:25.083
Yay!

00:01:03.125 --> 00:01:04.083
Good morning.

00:01:10.291 --> 00:01:13.083
I can't believe
you didn't make a move on me.

00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:17.208
How'd you manage to sleep
with this face and body next to you?

00:01:17.708 --> 00:01:19.833
You said there wouldn't be a second time.

00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:24.375
Yeah, but who actually
does as they're told?

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.208
Well, that's what you wanted, so…

00:01:30.375 --> 00:01:31.583
Oh.

00:01:32.083 --> 00:01:33.166
You're seeing someone?

00:01:35.208 --> 00:01:36.500
No way.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.583
Are you mad I left
without saying anything that day?

00:01:42.083 --> 00:01:43.541
Hmm.

00:01:46.708 --> 00:01:48.500
How should I put it?

00:01:50.041 --> 00:01:53.083
I haven't been sleeping well
since that day.

00:01:54.583 --> 00:01:56.541
Maybe you're my sleeping pill?

00:01:57.625 --> 00:02:01.000
Even so, how could you just sleep
and not do anything?

00:02:01.708 --> 00:02:04.458
Anyway, your food's getting cold.

00:02:10.458 --> 00:02:11.875
Sorry to say,

00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:14.458
but I'm not really a breakfast person.

00:02:19.333 --> 00:02:20.375
Yum!

00:02:27.083 --> 00:02:29.833
What? Don't look at me
with that "You're so cute" face.

00:02:29.916 --> 00:02:31.375
Was I making that face?

00:02:31.875 --> 00:02:32.791
You were.

00:02:34.541 --> 00:02:37.083
What's with that suggestive look?

00:02:37.166 --> 00:02:38.416
Don't worry.

00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:41.083
I won't fall for you any harder.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.666
You're doing as you're told again.

00:02:44.625 --> 00:02:46.500
Nice guys are such a turnoff.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.708
Here, try this too.

00:03:06.375 --> 00:03:07.375
Hey, wait!

00:03:09.166 --> 00:03:11.708
Thanks for the meal.
But I'm never seeing you again.

00:03:11.791 --> 00:03:14.208
No, wait. H-Hold on!

00:03:15.833 --> 00:03:18.875
Ugh, why did I even go see him?

00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.916
All right. Please go.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.083
Your coat!

00:03:23.125 --> 00:03:24.458
Your coat!

00:03:51.666 --> 00:03:54.875
WASABI EN SOIE

00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.041
BACK IN STOCK

00:04:11.833 --> 00:04:14.291
So, what did the inquiry forms say?

00:04:14.375 --> 00:04:15.291
Right.

00:04:15.375 --> 00:04:17.333
After Rainbow Palette came back,

00:04:17.416 --> 00:04:21.166
even Futago Confectionery
has been getting complaints.

00:04:21.666 --> 00:04:24.541
"I regret buying the wasabi chocolate."

00:04:25.041 --> 00:04:27.125
"The wasabi-flavored chocolate was awful."

00:04:27.708 --> 00:04:31.750
"I bought the wasabi chocolate
by mistake due to unclear labeling."

00:04:31.833 --> 00:04:34.125
"Can I get a refund?"

00:04:35.125 --> 00:04:38.916
They bought Rainbow Palette
and found wasabi chocolate inside.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.500
Basically, they didn't know the contents
and got an unpleasant surprise.

00:04:43.583 --> 00:04:46.916
They didn't know the contents?
It's written on the box.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.625
Not many people read it
when they buy the set.

00:04:50.458 --> 00:04:52.958
On top of that, wasabi prices are soaring,

00:04:53.041 --> 00:04:55.541
so suppliers are demanding higher prices.

00:04:56.375 --> 00:05:00.541
As you can see,
it's not selling well by itself either.

00:05:03.208 --> 00:05:04.333
What's HQ saying?

00:05:05.041 --> 00:05:08.333
"Too many complaints
and a low profit margin."

00:05:08.416 --> 00:05:10.916
They told us to stop production.

00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.000
Hmm?

00:05:30.083 --> 00:05:36.208
Why'd you decide to make
something as tricky as wasabi chocolate?

00:05:36.291 --> 00:05:40.708
Well, wasabi isn't meant
to be eaten on its own.

00:05:40.791 --> 00:05:45.666
And if you use too much of it,
it becomes a disaster.

00:05:46.333 --> 00:05:49.708
But get the balance just right,

00:05:49.791 --> 00:05:53.916
and it creates an exceptional flavor
no other ingredient can match.

00:05:55.125 --> 00:05:59.666
Even when it's hiding,
it does a splendid job.

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:00.958
I see.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:07.583
I'd say it's kind of like you, Hana.

00:06:07.666 --> 00:06:08.625
Me?

00:06:08.708 --> 00:06:10.083
Like me?

00:06:10.166 --> 00:06:12.166
I just wish

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:18.250
it'd step out
into the outside world a bit more.

00:06:19.833 --> 00:06:21.250
The outside world, huh?

00:06:21.333 --> 00:06:23.375
Yeah, that's what I'm hoping.

00:06:28.458 --> 00:06:30.750
It's true wasabi prices have gone up,

00:06:30.833 --> 00:06:33.916
but we barely use any at this shop.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.041
Oh. May I?

00:06:36.125 --> 00:06:38.083
Speaking as a member of the floor staff,

00:06:38.166 --> 00:06:40.583
Wasabi en Soie is popular
with foreign tourists.

00:06:40.666 --> 00:06:41.875
Yeah, it is!

00:06:42.458 --> 00:06:45.083
Even KitKats have a wasabi flavor, right?

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.208
By the way, aside from tourists,

00:06:48.708 --> 00:06:52.625
what kind of customers buy
Wasabi en Soie on its own?

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:57.666
Oh, I guess I should ask those
who know it best.

00:06:58.166 --> 00:07:03.375
Does anyone here think
Wasabi en Soie is the best it can be?

00:07:10.625 --> 00:07:14.458
So, why don't we all work on it together?

00:07:14.541 --> 00:07:16.458
Especially the chocolatiers.

00:07:17.833 --> 00:07:21.041
Is there any way
to renew and improve the recipe?

00:07:22.375 --> 00:07:26.458
What do you think, Chief?

00:07:29.916 --> 00:07:31.583
I…

00:07:34.916 --> 00:07:37.916
I've always believed
Chef Kenji's recipe was ideal.

00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:42.708
So, to me, the current flavor is
already the best it can be.

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:51.708
If you don't intend to change it,
we'll have to stop individual sales.

00:07:56.666 --> 00:07:59.250
Good work today. See you all tomorrow.

00:08:00.416 --> 00:08:01.958
-See you.
-See you.

00:08:07.875 --> 00:08:10.958
You wanted to speak up
in front of people but couldn't.

00:08:11.791 --> 00:08:12.916
Wow.

00:08:13.416 --> 00:08:15.541
I'd say that's a huge step forward.

00:08:15.625 --> 00:08:19.291
Even though I failed,
how can it be a step forward?

00:08:19.375 --> 00:08:22.583
You only failed because you tried.

00:08:22.666 --> 00:08:26.291
And trying is proof
you wanted something more.

00:08:27.083 --> 00:08:30.625
You used to not even want
to put yourself in that situation, right?

00:08:31.125 --> 00:08:33.250
Maybe you're right.

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:38.875
So, does that mean
I'm slowly getting better?

00:08:40.333 --> 00:08:41.291
Of course.

00:08:41.375 --> 00:08:44.416
You even made eye contact
and empathized with someone, didn't you?

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:45.958
Yes, I did.

00:08:46.041 --> 00:08:49.916
Physical symptoms don't go away overnight.

00:08:50.416 --> 00:08:54.291
But your heart
wants to change, Darth Vader.

00:08:54.791 --> 00:08:57.916
I think you just need to practice
one step at a time.

00:09:00.541 --> 00:09:02.000
Practice…

00:09:02.083 --> 00:09:05.041
Give yourself credit.

00:09:05.125 --> 00:09:07.625
You were able to step out
into the outside world.

00:09:08.625 --> 00:09:10.208
It's all thanks to Chef

00:09:10.708 --> 00:09:15.125
that even wasabi like me
could make it out into the world.

00:09:37.375 --> 00:09:38.541
Hmm.

00:09:47.625 --> 00:09:48.458
Oh.

00:09:54.458 --> 00:09:55.458
What?

00:10:06.375 --> 00:10:11.125
Thank you for reaching out
about the issues of the wasabi chocolate

00:10:11.208 --> 00:10:13.833
and ideas for its renewal.

00:10:13.916 --> 00:10:15.250
I appreciate it.

00:10:16.458 --> 00:10:19.375
Wasabi is a very bold ingredient.

00:10:19.458 --> 00:10:21.833
People either love it or hate it.

00:10:21.916 --> 00:10:24.458
But with just the right balance,

00:10:24.541 --> 00:10:28.958
it creates an exceptional flavor
no other ingredient can match.

00:10:29.458 --> 00:10:33.208
As for the renewal, I'd like to suggest

00:10:33.291 --> 00:10:36.166
changing the order of the flavors.

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:38.083
Be yummy.

00:10:38.666 --> 00:10:44.458
I brought the shy wasabi filling,
hiding on the inside, to the surface.

00:10:47.458 --> 00:10:50.416
First, your tongue feels a spicy kick.

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:53.208
Then, the sweet chocolate wraps around it,

00:10:53.791 --> 00:10:58.041
making it taste even smoother and sweeter.

00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:00.875
Mmm.

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:08.166
Plus, this way we can use less wasabi
than when it's used in the filling.

00:11:08.666 --> 00:11:10.375
Oh, there's that face.

00:11:10.958 --> 00:11:11.791
Hmm?

00:11:12.958 --> 00:11:15.000
You always make that face
when you're happy.

00:11:17.458 --> 00:11:18.708
Something good happened?

00:11:20.375 --> 00:11:21.625
Not really.

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:25.250
Something good did happen.

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:40.916
You've got this, Mr. Wasabi.

00:11:45.208 --> 00:11:46.458
P.S.

00:11:47.166 --> 00:11:49.583
Like the wasabi that came outside,

00:11:50.083 --> 00:11:55.041
I hope one day
I can meet everyone at Le Sauveur.

00:11:55.625 --> 00:11:57.750
From the Anonymous Chocolatier.

00:12:27.041 --> 00:12:27.916
I'll try one.

00:12:40.916 --> 00:12:42.083
How is it?

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:15.750
So annoying.

00:13:19.416 --> 00:13:21.375
It's annoyingly good.

00:13:22.583 --> 00:13:24.750
To come up with this idea,

00:13:25.583 --> 00:13:28.000
I have to admit they're a genius.

00:13:28.916 --> 00:13:30.541
It really is better.

00:13:31.041 --> 00:13:33.541
Yeah, I thought so too!

00:13:33.625 --> 00:13:35.958
First, the wasabi hits your tongue.

00:13:36.041 --> 00:13:38.583
Then, the sweetness
of the chocolate follows.

00:13:38.666 --> 00:13:41.125
I could eat a ton of these!

00:13:41.625 --> 00:13:45.291
The design screams "wasabi chocolate,"
and it's even cuter now.

00:13:45.375 --> 00:13:50.708
This is good,
but I still like Chef Kenji's version too.

00:13:51.208 --> 00:13:52.041
No.

00:13:53.041 --> 00:13:55.958
I lost this time. I'll admit it.

00:13:56.041 --> 00:13:58.458
No, it's not about winning or losing.

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:04.541
What matters is not giving up easily
and always striving for better.

00:14:06.583 --> 00:14:12.416
So, are we okay to go ahead
with this new Wasabi en Soie?

00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:14.958
Yes.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.125
Starting tomorrow,
we'll use the new recipe.

00:14:20.208 --> 00:14:21.208
Yes, Chief.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.041
-Let's compare them.
-So good.

00:14:24.125 --> 00:14:26.125
I think this could really sell.

00:14:28.125 --> 00:14:29.375
Good job, everyone.

00:14:30.208 --> 00:14:33.041
I thought you wouldn't accept it,
but that's our Chief.

00:14:35.333 --> 00:14:36.875
That reminds me, our boss…

00:14:38.458 --> 00:14:41.750
I don't think he's ever left before us.

00:14:42.666 --> 00:14:45.583
You think he feels the same way we do?

00:14:46.083 --> 00:14:47.500
Hard to say.

00:14:47.583 --> 00:14:49.791
Who knows what he's really thinking.

00:14:51.041 --> 00:14:52.416
Hmm.

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:55.208
Anyway, this calls for a celebration.

00:14:55.291 --> 00:14:58.625
Drinks, anyone? It's been a while!

00:14:59.208 --> 00:15:01.416
Nah, I'm wiped out today.

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:04.166
So of course I need to go for drinks!

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:05.833
Here we go again.

00:15:06.333 --> 00:15:08.791
These guys will use any excuse to drink.

00:15:08.875 --> 00:15:11.708
Hey, I heard that.
Show your senior some respect.

00:15:11.791 --> 00:15:12.958
Sure.

00:15:13.041 --> 00:15:16.000
You're coming too, newbie.
It's also your welcome party.

00:15:16.083 --> 00:15:19.666
Um, I think I'll pass.

00:15:19.750 --> 00:15:20.666
How come?

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:21.958
Uh…

00:15:22.041 --> 00:15:26.208
On a day like this, we've got to toast!

00:15:26.291 --> 00:15:27.375
Come on, join us.

00:15:27.458 --> 00:15:30.166
-Let's go, newbie!
-Yeah! All of us, together!

00:16:05.458 --> 00:16:07.458
Let's sit. Who's sitting where?

00:16:14.958 --> 00:16:16.375
I'll take this seat.

00:16:16.458 --> 00:16:17.500
Thanks.

00:16:36.541 --> 00:16:37.541
That was awesome!

00:16:37.625 --> 00:16:39.958
Thank you so much!

00:16:40.041 --> 00:16:41.375
Okay, next up,

00:16:41.458 --> 00:16:47.208
I'd like to give the mic
to our newest member, Ms. Lee Hana!

00:16:47.291 --> 00:16:49.166
-No!
-Please?

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:50.083
No way!

00:16:50.166 --> 00:16:53.666
-We want to hear you sing!
-No, I really can't.

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:56.458
I can't.

00:16:57.625 --> 00:16:58.583
You sing!

00:16:58.666 --> 00:16:59.833
Are you all right?

00:17:01.208 --> 00:17:02.416
I'm fine.

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:05.083
No, seriously,
I've had enough of your singing.

00:17:05.166 --> 00:17:08.583
Want me to play something?

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.125
We were just getting started. Come on!

00:17:14.208 --> 00:17:18.041
Do you know any Japanese songs?

00:17:18.125 --> 00:17:19.333
You can do it, Hana!

00:17:19.416 --> 00:17:21.750
Not me. The newbie's the star tonight.

00:17:21.833 --> 00:17:23.083
I'll give it a try.

00:17:24.791 --> 00:17:25.625
Uh-huh.

00:17:28.333 --> 00:17:29.625
I'll give it a try!

00:17:34.583 --> 00:17:35.750
Hanako!

00:18:03.083 --> 00:18:10.083
I look up as I walk

00:18:10.708 --> 00:18:17.708
So the tears won't fall

00:18:18.416 --> 00:18:25.166
Remembering those spring days

00:18:25.666 --> 00:18:31.000
But tonight I'm all alone

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:37.333
-She has a lovely voice.
-Yeah, she does.

00:18:40.541 --> 00:18:41.541
Um…

00:18:43.583 --> 00:18:46.208
There's something I want to tell everyone.

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:49.291
I am…

00:18:52.708 --> 00:18:54.250
Actually, I'm…

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.625
Hey, look at me!

00:19:22.791 --> 00:19:24.375
-Mr. Fujiwara?
-It's Mr. Fujiwara.

00:19:26.416 --> 00:19:27.583
Everyone,

00:19:27.666 --> 00:19:32.458
don't you think it's a bit rude
to make someone sing unprepared?

00:19:33.625 --> 00:19:34.500
Oh.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.000
Sorry about that.

00:19:36.708 --> 00:19:38.541
Why'd he suddenly show up?

00:19:39.125 --> 00:19:40.291
I know, right?

00:19:42.125 --> 00:19:44.500
I've got an important announcement.

00:19:44.583 --> 00:19:46.375
Oh, you can go back now.

00:19:46.875 --> 00:19:48.291
R-Right.

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:50.791
Okay.

00:19:51.291 --> 00:19:52.125
Is she okay?

00:19:53.291 --> 00:19:56.583
Mic check. Testing, one, two.

00:19:56.666 --> 00:19:58.541
Sorry to interrupt, everyone.

00:19:58.625 --> 00:20:02.541
I have a very
important announcement to make.

00:20:07.375 --> 00:20:10.666
Tonight's drinks

00:20:11.166 --> 00:20:12.583
are all on me!

00:20:30.833 --> 00:20:33.291
Here. Let me know if it's not enough.

00:20:34.458 --> 00:20:36.791
I wonder if Hana's okay.

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:42.166
Honestly, it's so much work
trying to cater to every employee.

00:20:42.250 --> 00:20:43.083
See you.

00:20:51.333 --> 00:20:52.625
Are you all right?

00:20:53.291 --> 00:20:54.583
I'm fine.

00:20:55.666 --> 00:20:57.333
Doesn't look like it.

00:20:57.416 --> 00:20:59.666
Just leave me alone!

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:01.500
Why are you following me?

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.916
This umbrella's extra big and sturdy.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.916
You came all this way
to brag about your umbrella?

00:21:08.625 --> 00:21:09.833
Come in here.

00:21:09.916 --> 00:21:11.333
I'm fine!

00:21:11.416 --> 00:21:13.375
Don't worry about me and just go!

00:21:18.666 --> 00:21:19.916
Are you crying?

00:21:22.958 --> 00:21:24.958
I'm just wet from the rain.

00:21:28.666 --> 00:21:30.625
What were you trying to say earlier?

00:21:38.166 --> 00:21:39.166
Are you

00:21:40.541 --> 00:21:42.791
afraid of being stared at?

00:21:45.916 --> 00:21:47.541
Could it be…

00:21:50.208 --> 00:21:52.750
I'm the only one you're okay with?

00:21:56.125 --> 00:21:57.208
I'm the same.

00:22:01.208 --> 00:22:02.375
I…

00:22:05.125 --> 00:22:07.333
I can't touch people.

00:22:08.916 --> 00:22:09.750
But…

00:22:12.958 --> 00:22:14.750
you're the only one I can.

00:22:16.083 --> 00:22:17.958
For some reason, it's just you.

00:22:38.375 --> 00:22:39.666
Take this.

00:22:42.791 --> 00:22:45.791
I can't let my employee catch a cold.

00:22:57.583 --> 00:22:58.958
Actually, no!

00:22:59.041 --> 00:23:00.000
I don't wanna get wet!

00:23:00.791 --> 00:23:02.583
-Are you okay?
-No, I'm not.

00:23:02.666 --> 00:23:05.125
Sorry, but could you go home
without the umbrella?

00:23:05.208 --> 00:23:06.583
-What?
-Oh, no.

00:23:06.666 --> 00:23:09.541
I really can't! Sorry!

00:23:09.625 --> 00:23:10.541
Huh? Oh!

00:23:17.791 --> 00:23:19.208
Seriously…

00:23:52.041 --> 00:23:53.333
What are you doing?

00:23:54.666 --> 00:23:56.125
Are you okay?

00:23:58.750 --> 00:23:59.916
Were you…

00:24:01.416 --> 00:24:02.500
crying?

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.875
Just wet from the rain.

00:24:06.958 --> 00:24:09.958
Anyway, you're rather dutiful,
chasing after me like this.

00:24:10.458 --> 00:24:13.166
I was worried
you might've collapsed on the way.

00:24:14.125 --> 00:24:16.208
That's why I ran after you too.

00:24:16.958 --> 00:24:20.750
I was ready to call an ambulance
if you'd passed out in the rain.

00:24:22.833 --> 00:24:23.666
But,

00:24:24.583 --> 00:24:28.000
I know you want to be left alone.

00:24:45.375 --> 00:24:47.583
Ever since my mom died,

00:24:48.958 --> 00:24:52.916
I've avoided
making eye contact with people.

00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:56.458
And I was totally fine with that.

00:24:58.708 --> 00:25:02.250
But sometimes I get sick
of always running away.

00:25:03.958 --> 00:25:07.041
I swore I'd try my best this time.

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:10.875
Like you did earlier?

00:25:13.458 --> 00:25:14.708
Yeah.

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:23.583
I thought I'd gotten a little better,
but nothing's changed.

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:28.500
I'm not asking for much.

00:25:31.041 --> 00:25:33.500
I just wanna look the one I'm into
in the eye and…

00:25:38.583 --> 00:25:41.458
Is there someone you feel that way about?

00:25:45.541 --> 00:25:46.458
There is.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:52.833
Sounds great.

00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:54.375
I just…

00:25:56.416 --> 00:26:00.375
want to be with the one I like,
lock eyes with them,

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:04.458
laugh together, cry together…

00:26:06.333 --> 00:26:07.750
I just wish

00:26:09.125 --> 00:26:11.375
I could do those things.

00:26:13.041 --> 00:26:14.541
I think I get it.

00:26:16.916 --> 00:26:18.916
There's so much I can't do either.

00:26:19.541 --> 00:26:23.958
Like messing around with friends,
putting an arm around their shoulders,

00:26:24.041 --> 00:26:25.208
or high-fiving.

00:26:27.958 --> 00:26:29.291
For that matter,

00:26:31.125 --> 00:26:33.333
I wanted to shake hands too.

00:26:34.875 --> 00:26:39.458
But everyone just thinks
I'm a nasty, over-the-top germophobe.

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:44.666
I…

00:26:47.458 --> 00:26:49.750
don't think people are dirty.

00:26:52.666 --> 00:26:53.666
It's just…

00:26:58.541 --> 00:27:00.041
I'm the one who's dirty.

00:27:00.791 --> 00:27:01.625
Yeah.

00:27:24.541 --> 00:27:26.166
I just think…

00:27:29.625 --> 00:27:32.458
I'm too dirty to touch anyone.

00:27:36.833 --> 00:27:37.833
That's why

00:27:39.625 --> 00:27:43.916
I felt comfortable
during the COVID-19 pandemic.

00:27:46.458 --> 00:27:49.000
Everyone in the world was like me,

00:27:50.166 --> 00:27:52.041
avoiding physical contact.

00:27:55.750 --> 00:28:00.208
But… that made me sad too.

00:28:01.291 --> 00:28:06.625
What was a nightmare for the world…
made me happy.

00:28:08.458 --> 00:28:12.666
I wonder why we're okay

00:28:14.083 --> 00:28:15.125
with each other.

00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:17.250
Beats me.

00:28:21.458 --> 00:28:22.791
Maybe

00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:24.958
we're soulmates?

00:28:25.041 --> 00:28:26.541
There's no way.

00:28:26.625 --> 00:28:27.708
You're right.

00:28:32.333 --> 00:28:38.500
But maybe… there's a reason for it.

00:28:38.583 --> 00:28:39.875
A reason?

00:28:39.958 --> 00:28:43.833
Maybe we can help each other.

00:28:43.916 --> 00:28:45.458
We can?

00:28:49.625 --> 00:28:51.583
Let's try practicing.

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:53.916
Like rehab.

00:28:55.458 --> 00:28:59.208
We'll touch and make eye contact,
since we're okay with each other.

00:28:59.791 --> 00:29:01.250
Let's do that.

00:29:05.541 --> 00:29:06.416
Uh, but,

00:29:06.916 --> 00:29:10.583
it'd be a real hassle
if we did that and you fell for me.

00:29:11.166 --> 00:29:13.750
No way. That will never happen.

00:29:14.583 --> 00:29:15.458
Yeah.

00:29:16.666 --> 00:29:20.333
I think we can practice.

00:29:22.333 --> 00:29:26.000
Well, there's no way
I'd fall for you either.

00:29:27.625 --> 00:29:28.458
Yeah.

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:31.875
All right.

00:29:34.625 --> 00:29:35.875
Let's give it a try.

00:29:45.458 --> 00:29:46.708
I want to change.

00:29:47.791 --> 00:29:48.791
I really do.

00:29:57.333 --> 00:29:58.541
Okay, then.

00:30:03.708 --> 00:30:04.666
Let's practice.

00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:15.208
Practice.

00:30:31.125 --> 00:30:32.375
Sorry.

00:30:32.458 --> 00:30:33.750
N-No.

00:30:35.708 --> 00:30:36.958
It's fine.

00:30:39.541 --> 00:30:41.666
I-It's just practice.

00:30:43.791 --> 00:30:44.875
Practice.

00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:52.666
Let's get better.

00:32:54.375 --> 00:32:55.250
Together.

00:33:33.083 --> 00:33:38.250
So he improved Kenji's recipe
to boost sales.

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:42.041
I guess he's become
a real businessman now.

00:33:44.666 --> 00:33:46.541
But he should quit wasting time

00:33:47.833 --> 00:33:50.291
and focus on obtaining the recipes.

00:33:51.375 --> 00:33:53.416
The convenience-store chocolates
need to launch

00:33:53.916 --> 00:33:56.208
in the second half of the year
as we planned.

00:33:57.333 --> 00:34:00.708
Get the other recipes quickly
and report back to me.

00:34:01.833 --> 00:34:02.666
Yes, sir.

00:34:03.583 --> 00:34:05.375
Once that place's no longer of use,

00:34:06.708 --> 00:34:09.416
we'll liquidate it.

00:34:13.416 --> 00:34:15.250
So you intend to shut down…

00:34:17.666 --> 00:34:18.833
Le Sauveur.

00:38:06.208 --> 00:38:09.041
