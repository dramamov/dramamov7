Hello, everyone.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.080
Welcome, friends from Century Real Estate.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.960
I'm today's instructor, Zhang Hui.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.479
It's a pleasure to meet you all.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.400
The goal of today's class

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.759
is to help everyone

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:44.680
use project management

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.759
to improve your sales performance.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.599
Ms. Zhang,

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.719
we're all real estate agents.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.879
We rarely deal with project management.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.960
Let's not waste time, okay?

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.400
Just get to the point.

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:58.000
I think this student's

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.039
question is a great one.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.240
Right, as real estate agents,

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.039
why do we need project management?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.840
I'm curious too.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.639
Why did you ask that question?

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:09.400
So I want to ask you,

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.759
how do you view your own work?

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.000
And how do you understand project management?

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:15.599
Our job is

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:17.800
to sell houses quickly, well, and efficiently.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.360
As for project management...

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:22.599
Let me help answer that.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.199
Project management

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:27.039
is more than just process management.

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:30.240
It covers planning, execution,

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.560
monitoring, closing, and more.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.520
During real estate sales,

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.599
we need to use

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:37.479
project management concepts and methods

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:40.159
to organize our sales process.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.360
Let's all look at the PPT.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.039
Hello? Yes, go ahead.

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:04.000
Okay, sure.

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.160
Thank you all for your cooperation today.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.839
If what you learned today

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:23.240
was helpful to you,

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.120
please fill out

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.399
a positive feedback form.

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:27.120
Thank you.

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.000
If you felt

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.279
satisfied with today's class,

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:32.240
just check this box right here.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.959
Thank you all, thank you.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.879
Do you think the manager is targeting us?

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.920
Why teach project management to salespeople?

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.160
Will they even use it?

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.680
He even called them potential clients.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.879
Most importantly,

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:56.879
he knows your specialty is business consulting.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.879
It's like making a blacksmith do a carpenter's job.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.800
If we lose this deal,

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.399
we'll get blamed out of nowhere.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.639
Li Yihan, thank you so much for today.

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:07.839
You, a team leader, helped me as an assistant.

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:09.639
I'll treat you to dinner another day.

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:10.519
No worries, really.

00:05:10.519 --> 00:05:11.879
You did a great job teaching today.

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:14.360
You shut him down in just a few words.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.399
Your schedule lately

00:05:18.399 --> 00:05:19.759
looks pretty packed.

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:21.639
You probably don't have time to eat.

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:22.639
Not really.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.079
Watch out for low blood sugar.

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:28.360
My cousin brought this chocolate from abroad.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.879
Keep it in case you get low blood sugar.

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:43.079
Um...

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.600
Ms. Zhang, I really didn't know

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.879
if you eat chocolate.

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:47.920
I'll remember next time.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:48.319
No, that's not it.

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:49.639
Oh, right, also...

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:51.560
I answered a call for you outside.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.879
That guy said he can't pretend to be your boyfriend anymore.

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:55.639
He'll transfer the five thousand yuan to you soon.

00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:01.319
No, it's like this, really.

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:04.160
You go ahead, I'll get back to work.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:04.920
Um...

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:09.480
If you need anything, just call me.

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:10.560
I'm always here.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.519
Li Yihan, are you free tonight?

00:06:17.519 --> 00:06:19.439
How about dinner at my place tonight?

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.439
Sounds good.

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:37.360
Let's play a quick truth-telling game.

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:39.560
You have three seconds to answer.

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:43.480
One rule: no lying.

00:06:44.399 --> 00:06:47.480
How did you and Hui's love story begin?

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.959
How did it start?

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:53.439
It was a stormy, thunderous night.

00:06:54.439 --> 00:06:58.279
Hui looked at me with her gentle,

00:06:58.279 --> 00:07:00.680
clear, bright eyes.

00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:02.759
I knew we were meant to be together.

00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:05.920
Because she totally zapped me.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:10.920
Be serious.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.920
How long have you two been dating?

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.240
Almost half a year.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.319
To be exact, six months and eight days.

00:07:19.319 --> 00:07:20.680
Because every day with Hui

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.439
I remember.

00:07:21.439 --> 00:07:22.920
Right, including today,

00:07:22.959 --> 00:07:24.079
it's exactly eight days.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.079
Li Yihan, you're so thoughtful.

00:07:28.079 --> 00:07:28.879
That's how it should be.

00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:29.680
That's love.

00:07:30.279 --> 00:07:31.639
Where was your first date?

00:07:32.439 --> 00:07:33.240
It was...

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.519
at a really cool,

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.720
very, very elegant

00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:39.720
and romantic café.

00:07:39.839 --> 00:07:41.000
Their coffee

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.399
and French desserts

00:07:43.399 --> 00:07:44.199
were delicious.

00:07:44.199 --> 00:07:45.519
And the atmosphere was great.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.000
As Hui's boyfriend,

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.040
is there anything you'd like to say to her?

00:07:58.759 --> 00:08:00.000
Honestly, sometimes

00:08:00.079 --> 00:08:01.639
I feel like I'm not her boyfriend.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.800
She's so strong, independent, and confident.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.079
She doesn't seem to need anyone.

00:08:11.079 --> 00:08:11.800
And I

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.319
am more like her personal comedian.

00:08:14.319 --> 00:08:15.600
When she's upset

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:16.600
or bored,

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.240
I cheer her up with my humor.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:23.480
Right.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.879
What would you give up for Hui?

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.920
I'd give up everything for Hui.

00:08:32.519 --> 00:08:34.320
Because she's truly

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.960
the most important person to me.

00:08:42.639 --> 00:08:43.399
Hui.

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.159
Zhengui.

00:08:45.159 --> 00:08:46.039
Let's have a quick meeting.

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.399
Take a seat first.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.240
Okay.

00:08:49.799 --> 00:08:50.960
Just sit for a bit.

00:09:05.639 --> 00:09:06.879
What do you two think?

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:10.399
No problem. You lie without blinking.

00:09:10.399 --> 00:09:12.399
Your acting is pretty good.

00:09:14.399 --> 00:09:15.960
Why did you pick him to pretend
to be your boyfriend?

00:09:16.919 --> 00:09:18.840
It's not that he's super clever.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.519
It's just that the fake boyfriend
I hired

00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:22.799
ditched me at the last minute.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.480
Plus, Li Yihan was happy to help me out.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:29.399
Isn't it because he's decent-looking?

00:09:29.879 --> 00:09:32.399
Do I look like someone
who's that shallow?

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.799
If you both think it's fine,

00:09:35.919 --> 00:09:37.600
then I'm not worried about my mom.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.480
You know how she is.

00:09:40.639 --> 00:09:41.960
My mom's a teacher.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.720
She's strict about everything.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.679
And she always blows things up.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:49.279
I'm really afraid she'll spot a flaw.

00:09:54.799 --> 00:09:55.600
Got it.

00:09:56.279 --> 00:09:57.759
Let me give you two a practice run.

00:10:06.559 --> 00:10:07.480
You look pretty convincing.

00:10:08.039 --> 00:10:09.559
You two are too much.

00:10:09.879 --> 00:10:10.679
I'm going grocery shopping.

00:10:10.679 --> 00:10:11.799
What does Auntie like to eat?

00:10:11.799 --> 00:10:12.600
Pasta.

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:14.360
It's for Auntie, not you.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:18.639
Anything's fine.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:20.279
Okay.

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:32.240
Auntie.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:32.879
She's here.

00:10:33.279 --> 00:10:35.039
Let's see what to buy today.

00:10:35.039 --> 00:10:35.840
These shrimp look good.

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.879
Are these sea shrimp twenty-four per jin?

00:10:37.879 --> 00:10:38.519
That's right.

00:10:38.519 --> 00:10:39.279
One jin.

00:10:39.399 --> 00:10:40.519
Yes, one jin.

00:10:40.639 --> 00:10:41.480
This one's nice.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.240
See, I only have a little left.

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:44.000
I'll take one jin.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:44.759
Okay.

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.120
No, no, make it two jin.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:48.159
Okay.

00:10:55.559 --> 00:10:56.320
Right.

00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.279
I'm back.

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:01.559
Is it pasta?

00:11:01.639 --> 00:11:02.440
Yes.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.080
How long until Auntie arrives?

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:07.120
About fifteen minutes.

00:11:07.919 --> 00:11:08.720
I'll help you.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.399
Go play with them.

00:11:14.399 --> 00:11:15.919
Come on, whose turn is it?

00:11:15.919 --> 00:11:17.279
Go ahead, bomb.

00:11:37.679 --> 00:11:40.120
Zhengui, can I borrow your white wine?

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.759
Sure. I barely want to drink it myself.

00:11:42.759 --> 00:11:43.600
There's no time.

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:56.200
Cooking sometimes needs a sense of ritual.

00:11:56.639 --> 00:11:57.480
Like with pasta.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.279
If you skip this step,

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:00.480
what you cook

00:12:01.519 --> 00:12:03.320
always seems to lack something.

00:12:03.559 --> 00:12:05.159
Boil for twelve minutes.

00:12:05.159 --> 00:12:07.480
That's how you get the perfect texture.

00:12:08.639 --> 00:12:10.480
In Italian, it's called

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.399
Al dente

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:16.200
That chewy, springy bite.

00:12:17.879 --> 00:12:19.840
The sauce is the soul of pasta.

00:12:20.519 --> 00:12:23.240
First, fry bacon in butter.

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.399
Add mushrooms and onions for aroma.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:33.000
Then pour in plenty of fresh milk.

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:38.279
And some cream.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.279
Add a bit of black pepper.

00:12:42.759 --> 00:12:43.600
Salt.

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.919
Put in perfectly cooked pasta.

00:12:48.159 --> 00:12:51.840
Let every strand soak up the rich sauce.

00:12:53.279 --> 00:12:54.279
Simmer to thicken.

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:58.279
Don't forget a sprinkle of parsley.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.919
Pasta and pumpkin cream soup
are a perfect match.

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:31.639
While steaming the pumpkin,

00:13:31.879 --> 00:13:35.200
let's make a Tuna Vegetable Salad.

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:37.120
The tang of the salad

00:13:37.279 --> 00:13:39.559
balances out the creamy sweetness.

00:14:01.799 --> 00:14:03.440
Steamed pumpkin

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:06.440
gets blended into a smooth puree.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.039
Onion.

00:14:11.399 --> 00:14:12.240
Mushroom.

00:14:12.639 --> 00:14:13.480
Sauté until fragrant.

00:14:14.799 --> 00:14:16.000
Add water and simmer.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:23.679
Salt.

00:14:27.559 --> 00:14:28.159
Sugar.

00:14:29.519 --> 00:14:30.559
A little of each.

00:14:38.759 --> 00:14:40.519
Serve it in white porcelain.

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:41.960
It looks best that way.

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:54.480
Drizzle with cream.

00:14:57.279 --> 00:14:58.120
Perfect.

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:16.720
Mom, Auntie.

00:15:17.039 --> 00:15:18.000
Long time no see.

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.000
Why did you bring me something?

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.320
Don't flatter yourself.

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:23.360
It's not for you.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:24.799
It's for your friends.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:27.840
Little Zhengui.

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:30.080
How did you get so tall?

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:32.000
I'm already twenty-four.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:35.440
Mom, this is Nian'er.

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:36.639
The one I always mention to you.

00:15:36.639 --> 00:15:37.480
Hello, Auntie.

00:15:37.519 --> 00:15:38.399
Hello, Nian'er.

00:15:38.519 --> 00:15:39.879
Zhang Hui always talks about you.

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:42.480
Why are you cooking?

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.159
I wanted to take you all out to eat.

00:15:45.159 --> 00:15:46.039
This is so much trouble.

00:15:46.039 --> 00:15:47.000
It's no trouble, Auntie.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.480
I love cooking for everyone.

00:15:48.919 --> 00:15:50.159
Please sit, I'll get busy.

00:15:50.159 --> 00:15:50.840
Okay.

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:51.639
Come in and have a seat.

00:15:53.879 --> 00:15:54.679
Hello, Auntie.

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:57.279
Hello.

00:16:01.679 --> 00:16:03.840
Steak—first, sprinkle black pepper.

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:09.159
Sea salt.

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:13.919
Marinate.

00:16:15.679 --> 00:16:18.960
Give it a massage to help the flavor.

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.919
Hot oil in the pan.

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:31.600
Sear both sides for forty-five seconds.

00:16:34.639 --> 00:16:37.200
Precise heat and timing

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:39.679
are the key to a perfect steak.

00:16:47.159 --> 00:16:48.360
Add some butter.

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:52.000
It takes the steak to a new level.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:54.639
Floral notes with a hint of pine.

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.600
The taste of rosemary.

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.400
Slice against the grain—tastes better.

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:54.640
Auntie, I made this just for you.

00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:58.039
Welcome to our home.

00:17:58.319 --> 00:17:59.480
Thank you, Zhengui.

00:18:00.119 --> 00:18:01.319
The dishes are ready.

00:18:06.039 --> 00:18:09.400
Nian'er made so many delicious dishes.

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:13.119
I've never had any of these before.

00:18:13.359 --> 00:18:14.440
Nian'er worked so hard.

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:15.640
It's no trouble, Auntie.

00:18:15.759 --> 00:18:17.279
Everything looks, smells, and tastes great.

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:18.640
Everyone, dig in.

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:19.640
Or the food will get cold.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.240
Once again, welcome to our home, Auntie.

00:18:31.319 --> 00:18:32.119
Welcome.

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.519
Thank you, thank you.

00:18:38.359 --> 00:18:39.160
Auntie.

00:18:40.319 --> 00:18:43.599
Here, this is Creamy Shrimp Pasta.

00:18:45.559 --> 00:18:46.640
And here is the steak.

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:48.200
If you're not used to medium rare,

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.279
I made a medium-well one just for you.

00:18:50.559 --> 00:18:52.319
Thank you, Nian. That's so thoughtful.

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:57.240
Go ahead, eat.

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:09.240
Delicious.

00:19:49.559 --> 00:19:50.640
Really tasty.

00:21:20.079 --> 00:21:21.599
So, Xiao Li...

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:24.119
How long have you and Hui been together?

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:27.240
Auntie, Hui and I have known each other
for half a year.

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:29.920
To be exact, six months and eight days.

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:34.319
Wow, you remember so clearly.

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:36.440
So, how did you two meet?

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:37.680
A seminar... or in the park.

00:21:47.519 --> 00:21:49.440
Maybe you should think carefully.

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:51.759
Or discuss it together.

00:21:51.759 --> 00:21:54.000
Was it the park or the seminar?

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:57.519
Mom, I...

00:21:57.519 --> 00:21:59.000
Auntie, it's like this—

00:21:59.359 --> 00:22:03.559
The three of us were strolling in the park.

00:22:04.079 --> 00:22:06.440
Then Li Yihan was there.

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:09.640
He was walking his dog.

00:22:09.759 --> 00:22:11.319
His dog was misbehaving.

00:22:11.319 --> 00:22:12.799
It ran over to us—

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:15.960
It peed right next to us.

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:17.759
He kept apologizing like crazy.

00:22:17.759 --> 00:22:19.400
After apologizing, he...

00:22:19.759 --> 00:22:21.119
Later, we ran into each other again.

00:22:21.119 --> 00:22:22.000
And then...

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.000
After that...

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.240
It was at a business management seminar.

00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.240
That was our second meeting.

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:29.240
She was standing on stage.

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:30.440
Her speech was amazing.

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:33.160
Her unique charm really attracted me.

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:34.079
I think Hui is

00:22:34.079 --> 00:22:36.839
a well-mannered, well-raised girl.

00:22:38.839 --> 00:22:39.839
I see.

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:44.039
Auntie, I noticed you love shrimp.

00:22:44.079 --> 00:22:46.759
Here, have some more. Eat up.

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:48.839
Nian's dish is so delicious.

00:22:48.839 --> 00:22:50.119
I have to eat more.

00:22:54.119 --> 00:22:56.240
Xiao Li, what do you do for work?

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:58.160
Auntie, we work at the same company.

00:22:58.160 --> 00:22:59.200
Just in different positions.

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.440
I'm in sales.

00:23:01.839 --> 00:23:03.880
So, for your future career,

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:06.039
do you have any plans or goals?

00:23:06.599 --> 00:23:07.240
Well...

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:08.559
I plan to...

00:23:08.559 --> 00:23:10.119
First, stay at our current company.

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:14.160
Work hard, learn, and improve ourselves.

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:15.400
And expand our network.

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:17.279
Once we've grown enough,

00:23:17.279 --> 00:23:18.279
and gained enough experience,

00:23:18.279 --> 00:23:19.880
we'll start our own studio.

00:23:21.519 --> 00:23:22.160
Your parents...

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:24.240
Mom, that's enough.

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:28.880
Let me toast Auntie.

00:23:30.599 --> 00:23:33.720
My parents were often away when I was little.

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:35.039
You always took care of me.

00:23:35.039 --> 00:23:36.319
I'm really grateful to you.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.480
I was so lonely at home.

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:41.440
I often went to your house for meals.

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.240
Every time I saw you all

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:44.640
so happy together as a family,

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:45.920
I felt so blessed.

00:23:46.119 --> 00:23:47.799
I've always envied Hui.

00:23:47.799 --> 00:23:49.480
Because your cooking is amazing.

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:50.680
Thank you.

00:24:00.559 --> 00:24:01.680
See you next time.

00:24:03.519 --> 00:24:04.799
Thank you, little Zhen Gui.

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:07.119
Nian, thank you for all your hard work tonight.

00:24:07.119 --> 00:24:08.200
It wasn't hard, Auntie.

00:24:09.039 --> 00:24:09.880
Mom, let's go.

00:24:10.279 --> 00:24:11.200
I'll walk you out.

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:12.759
Auntie, take care on the way.

00:24:12.759 --> 00:24:13.920
Alright, goodbye!

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.279
A mother's love is truly great.

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:25.400
Why are you suddenly so sentimental?

00:24:26.079 --> 00:24:27.400
I remember when I was little,

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.200
Hui told me

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:31.519
her mom didn't like shrimp.

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:33.559
But just now...

00:24:33.559 --> 00:24:36.640
I remember she actually does like it.

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:39.599
She just knows Hui loves it.

00:24:39.839 --> 00:24:42.720
So she pretends not to like it.

00:24:46.039 --> 00:24:48.799
I think she shouldn't lie to her mom.

00:24:49.119 --> 00:24:50.799
She should find a good boyfriend.

00:24:53.039 --> 00:24:55.119
It's right not to lie to Hui's mom.

00:24:55.359 --> 00:24:56.640
But just to avoid lying,

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:59.039
dating someone isn't the answer.

00:25:01.599 --> 00:25:02.240
Whatever.

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:03.640
Just don't be with Li Yihan.

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:04.400
That's all.

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:06.200
Why?

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:14.640
That... Li Yihan.

00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:17.839
Men as considerate as you

00:25:17.839 --> 00:25:20.000
are really rare in this world.

00:25:20.039 --> 00:25:23.400
How about we exchange contacts?

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:24.640
Keep in touch.

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:39.000
Why?

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:43.440
Your dad is planning to retire for good.

00:25:43.839 --> 00:25:45.240
He's been rehired for so many years.

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:47.000
It's time to take care of his health.

00:25:47.559 --> 00:25:49.880
You need to watch his drinking.

00:25:50.759 --> 00:25:51.640
If you're home,

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:53.319
he won't touch a drop.

00:25:53.559 --> 00:25:54.640
If I say one word,

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:55.799
he'll have ten thousand to say back.

00:25:55.799 --> 00:25:57.039
I don't want to mess with him.

00:25:58.119 --> 00:26:01.200
Mom, my job is getting better now.

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:03.440
The apartment Uncle saw back then—

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:05.880
I think the smaller one next door is nice.

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.599
Let me save up a bit more.

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:09.799
I'll buy it outright when I can.

00:26:11.039 --> 00:26:13.279
Is the bathroom at home still leaking?

00:26:13.599 --> 00:26:15.200
Also, Uncle told me

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.279
the kitchen always smells like gas.

00:26:17.799 --> 00:26:19.119
You should get someone to check it.

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:21.440
Save your money for yourself.

00:26:21.559 --> 00:26:23.200
Don't always worry about us.

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:25.680
And also...

00:26:27.119 --> 00:26:29.200
You haven't been answering your dad's calls.

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.640
Does he always push you to get married?

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:32.920
Is it driving you crazy?

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:36.519
I've told him so many times.

00:26:36.519 --> 00:26:37.880
He just won't listen.

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:40.720
Now he only talks about that.

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:48.880
Mom, does Dad think

00:26:49.319 --> 00:26:51.400
I'm a failure for not marrying?

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:55.599
That's not what he means.

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:58.920
He just wants you to find real happiness.

00:27:06.279 --> 00:27:07.079
Hui...

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.720
That Li Yihan just now—

00:27:12.519 --> 00:27:14.240
he's not really your boyfriend, is he?

00:27:18.559 --> 00:27:19.519
So delicious.

00:27:24.599 --> 00:27:26.839
If you two really dated for over half a year,

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.640
how could he not know about it?

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:33.200
Mom, I'm sorry.

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:41.880
Actually, about you breaking up with Runze,

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:43.400
I've known for a long time.

00:27:44.039 --> 00:27:45.200
But don't worry.

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:46.640
Your dad still doesn't know.

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.440
Then how did you find out?

00:27:53.279 --> 00:27:55.039
Your uncle told me.

00:27:55.599 --> 00:27:57.240
When you posted on your Moments,

00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:59.279
you blocked me and your dad.

00:27:59.559 --> 00:28:01.880
But you forgot to block your uncle.

00:28:05.039 --> 00:28:06.079
Don't be upset.

00:28:06.319 --> 00:28:07.920
You don't need to worry about your dad.

00:28:08.279 --> 00:28:10.119
If he finds out, he'll nag you.

00:28:10.319 --> 00:28:12.240
I have plenty of ways to handle him.

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:22.039
Hui, can I ask you one more thing?

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:25.680
You were with Runze for so long.

00:28:26.119 --> 00:28:27.759
Why did you suddenly break up?

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:31.799
I thought he truly loved me.

00:28:32.759 --> 00:28:33.599
But when I talked to him

00:28:33.599 --> 00:28:35.440
about getting engaged, I realized

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:37.519
he wouldn't give up a whole forest

00:28:37.519 --> 00:28:39.319
just for one tree—me.

00:28:40.599 --> 00:28:42.440
Maybe I'm not good enough,

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:44.920
or maybe he has other options.

00:28:48.519 --> 00:28:51.440
Mom, did I let you down again,

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:52.480
your expectations?

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.400
Hui, remember this:

00:28:58.599 --> 00:29:01.119
Whether you have a boyfriend or get married,

00:29:01.119 --> 00:29:03.079
you'll never let us down.

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:06.519
All my life,

00:29:06.759 --> 00:29:09.200
I've lived under others' expectations.

00:29:09.559 --> 00:29:12.039
So my daughter

00:29:13.039 --> 00:29:14.880
should live her own way,

00:29:15.519 --> 00:29:19.680
safe, healthy, and happy.
