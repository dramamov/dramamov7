Sleepwalkers

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.599
Never wake her up

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.919
She could become confused

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:42.759
Though she's silly enough already

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:10.840
What are you up to again?

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:17.199
I just really miss

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:19.120
us snuggling under blankets as kids

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.560
those days we dreamed together

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:23.519
and shared snacks together

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:25.759
We were neighbors back then

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.839
Go ahead

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.600
Are you pretending to sleepwalk again?

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.920
Trying to scare Sis Nian'er?

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.720
Life needs a little fun, right?

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.600
Plus, only her room has snacks

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.720
So what am I supposed to do?

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:40.399
You've loved snacks since you were little

00:04:40.399 --> 00:04:43.480
My mom still talks about it

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.439
She says every time she visited us

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:47.959
she'd see almost expired bread in the fridge

00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:49.519
She always wanted to try a bite

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.120
That's my only hobby

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.720
How could I just give it up?

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.639
No one climbs into my bed for nothing

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:08.040
Up so late and not sleeping

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.079
You must be up to something

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:18.720
I was halfway asleep

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:20.439
then suddenly remembered

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:25.439
tomorrow is our first anniversary

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.079
Not tomorrow, it's today

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.199
It's past midnight already

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:29.959
Yeah

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:32.639
Shouldn't we celebrate?

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.959
Nian'er has cooked us dinner for a year

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:36.439
I've gained five pounds

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.560
My mom cooked for me twenty years

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.439
She wasn't as efficient as Nian'er in one year

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.480
But lately she's had trouble walking

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.519
So maybe we should

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.800
take her out for a fancy meal

00:05:52.079 --> 00:05:54.519
If you really want to thank Sis Nian'er

00:05:54.519 --> 00:05:56.199
then learn to cook properly

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:58.000
If we eat out once

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.600
we'll have to eat at home for days

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.600
Talking about spending, I have to mention you

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.040
Are you still not financially independent?

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.120
You keep saying you're independent

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:09.600
It's been a year now

00:06:10.079 --> 00:06:11.079
The flagpole's fallen

00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:12.800
Are we just leaving it down?

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:13.839
And also

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.519
Our company hasn't been doing well lately

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.439
The whole department's had pay cuts

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.240
Who says I'm not independent?

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.639
This month's money

00:06:24.079 --> 00:06:25.800
I sent it all back to my parents

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:29.040
I'm officially broke now

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:31.199
And my streaming money

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.600
won't be available for a few days

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:35.639
You're right

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.720
Maybe this year we really should

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.240
keep things simple

00:06:42.399 --> 00:06:46.600
Like just eating chips

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:53.199
Even eating chips, wipe your hands clean

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:07.839
I've truly been happy this year

00:07:11.079 --> 00:07:14.120
I feel like I can support myself soon

00:07:17.759 --> 00:07:18.560
But

00:07:19.319 --> 00:07:21.600
There's something I still don't get

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:31.680
What is life, really?

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.639
Life

00:07:39.199 --> 00:07:43.079
It's like taking a train trip

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:48.480
Sometimes you board the wrong train

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.480
but it still gets you to the right place

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.480
Just like me

00:07:59.199 --> 00:08:01.639
I never planned to be a teacher

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.319
Come on, sleep well

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:16.680
Watch your head

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:10.519
Your body

00:09:11.159 --> 00:09:13.799
Shouldn't it be my brilliant brain?

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:20.799
But Cong Ge

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.440
It's Sunday today

00:09:28.879 --> 00:09:29.679
Morning

00:09:38.519 --> 00:09:39.840
Slept twelve hours straight

00:09:39.919 --> 00:09:40.799
Youth is wonderful

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.200
Who's young? We're almost thirty

00:09:44.799 --> 00:09:46.519
Zhenggui, you sleepwalked again last night

00:09:46.559 --> 00:09:47.360
Aren't you scared?

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:51.200
Oh, I'm used to it

00:09:56.679 --> 00:09:58.039
What do you two want to eat today?

00:09:58.039 --> 00:09:59.759
It's our first anniversary today

00:09:59.759 --> 00:10:01.440
I think we should have seafood

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.519
We can make lobster the main dish

00:10:03.519 --> 00:10:04.480
And pair it with champagne

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:07.679
And two, no, one brown crab, then...

00:10:07.679 --> 00:10:08.919
Stop, Li Zhenggui

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:12.120
Alright, it's rare we're both off today

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.919
Let's tidy up and go to the supermarket

00:10:14.559 --> 00:10:16.080
Let's treat ourselves a little

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.039
Let's go, let's go, let's go

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.919
Change clothes, change clothes, change clothes

00:10:22.919 --> 00:10:23.639
Let's go

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:27.679
Hurry up

00:10:28.559 --> 00:10:30.039
The brown crab's almost sold out

00:10:45.639 --> 00:10:46.720
Are we doing a runway show?

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.200
I'm the supermodel

00:10:52.879 --> 00:10:53.399
Let's go

00:11:13.519 --> 00:11:15.320
I've been drafted, you two go ahead

00:11:15.919 --> 00:11:17.200
Alright, I'll cook tonight

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:17.960
I'll try to get back soon

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:18.519
I'm heading out now

00:11:18.519 --> 00:11:19.320
Take it easy

00:11:32.559 --> 00:11:33.320
Hello

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:35.600
Teacher Zhang, a big client is coming tomorrow

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.000
There's a group class to discuss

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Please hurry back and organize the materials

00:11:39.159 --> 00:11:40.399
I'll send them to you soon

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.600
We'll be there soon too

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:42.519
Okay

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:45.879
Good things come in pairs

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.039
Is this person targeting you?

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.200
He used to help you with everything

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.399
Now look at his attitude

00:11:51.399 --> 00:11:52.200
So annoying

00:11:52.559 --> 00:11:53.480
Who cares

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.639
I'll get to work now

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.200
Go to the supermarket yourself

00:11:56.919 --> 00:11:57.720
Be careful

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.440
Wait, does that mean I can spend money?

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:11.720
Director Liang

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:13.399
Things inside might not be great

00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:14.399
Do you want to wait before going in?

00:12:14.399 --> 00:12:14.919
It's fine

00:12:14.919 --> 00:12:16.320
What's going on now?

00:12:16.399 --> 00:12:18.360
The director says I'm too inexperienced

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.200
The voice actors aren't in good shape either

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.320
And the job is urgent

00:12:21.559 --> 00:12:23.399
Sorry for the trouble, Director Liang

00:12:23.519 --> 00:12:25.320
It's fine, give me the script, I'll handle it

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.639
Hello, I'm the voice director Liang Nian'er

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:47.200
Susu, it's me

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:48.440
Let's do a test

00:12:48.679 --> 00:12:49.679
Okay, Sis Nian'er

00:12:58.639 --> 00:13:00.240
Sorry, I'll step out for a moment

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.519
I don't like scripts with brothel scenes

00:13:07.519 --> 00:13:08.720
Cong Ge knows my principles

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:09.799
What did you tell him?

00:13:09.919 --> 00:13:11.279
Sorry, sorry, Director Liang

00:13:11.279 --> 00:13:12.440
I really didn't know

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.200
The director just yelled at me so harshly

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.320
It's Teacher Susu's first time too

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:16.440
Taking on a role like this

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.679
I really panicked

00:13:17.679 --> 00:13:19.279
I quickly told Mr. Li

00:13:19.399 --> 00:13:20.200
I didn't go into details

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.200
Didn't expect he'd have you come over

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.120
Are you a professional voice actor?

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.679
Can't you speak up a bit louder?

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:27.200
Can't you sound a bit more charming?

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:28.480
Have you ever dated anyone?

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.799
Director, please take a break

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.559
We're all professionals here

00:13:38.559 --> 00:13:39.879
We can meet your requirements

00:13:45.399 --> 00:13:47.080
Susu, try to remember

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.840
We dubbed a game before

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:50.840
We invited a senior to voice the fox spirit

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:52.759
Do you remember how that senior performed?

00:13:52.759 --> 00:13:54.080
I remember, Sis Nian'er

00:13:54.279 --> 00:13:56.440
Let's try a few takes like that

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:57.440
Okay, Sis Nian'er

00:14:30.919 --> 00:14:31.720
Hey

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:41.080
Where's my food?

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.639
Xiaoyu, give these two to the mixing engineer

00:14:47.639 --> 00:14:48.279
Okay

00:14:48.759 --> 00:14:51.080
No wonder you're such an experienced voice director

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.279
I think you're amazing

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.799
I only have a small part

00:14:54.919 --> 00:14:57.000
How many late nights have I filmed?

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.720
I've cast over forty female extras just in Hengdian

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.559
Right, boss?

00:15:00.559 --> 00:15:01.799
Yes, yes, well shot

00:15:01.919 --> 00:15:04.399
Let me tell you, the lighting, the composition

00:15:04.399 --> 00:15:05.759
These lines, this...

00:15:06.399 --> 00:15:07.279
You pursue your art

00:15:07.279 --> 00:15:08.679
We're not qualified to judge

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.080
But for those working with you

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:12.360
You really have no boundaries

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:13.919
No matter what kind of role we take

00:15:13.919 --> 00:15:15.960
We always treat it professionally

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.679
Just because we voice these roles

00:15:17.679 --> 00:15:19.679
doesn't mean you can disrespect us

00:15:20.399 --> 00:15:21.919
It's been unpleasant meeting you

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:23.080
Hope your box office does well

00:15:23.279 --> 00:15:24.440
We won't meet again

00:15:26.279 --> 00:15:27.799
You little brat

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.399
Ms. Liang, thank you for your hard work

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:42.879
Challenge: spend nothing at all

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:44.440
Take seafood home

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:51.240
Auntie

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.320
What fish do you have today?

00:15:53.399 --> 00:15:55.799
Young lady, haven't seen you in days

00:15:55.919 --> 00:15:57.720
All the fish today are very fresh

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:58.840
Take a look yourself

00:15:58.840 --> 00:15:59.519
Okay

00:16:06.879 --> 00:16:08.840
Auntie, are you feeling unwell?

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:13.840
Gout, you know, it's really painful

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:15.200
Go ahead and look

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.480
See if there's anything you like

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:17.879
I'll pack it up for you

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.519
If you don't buy

00:16:19.519 --> 00:16:20.799
I'll close up shop

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.440
Auntie, how about this

00:16:26.559 --> 00:16:29.000
I'll help you sell fish this afternoon

00:16:29.679 --> 00:16:31.519
Just tell me what to do and I'll do it

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:35.480
But could you give me a big fish?

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:39.000
You can't handle this job

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:41.279
Standing here for hours is tough

00:16:41.279 --> 00:16:42.879
No, no, it's not hard

00:16:42.879 --> 00:16:43.440
No way

00:16:43.799 --> 00:16:44.720
Oh dear, young lady

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:46.200
You really want to help me sell fish?

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.080
Of course I do

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.120
Here, put this on

00:17:01.799 --> 00:17:02.559
Grab that

00:17:02.559 --> 00:17:04.039
The knife for scaling fish

00:17:04.039 --> 00:17:04.480
This one

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:05.200
Yes, yes, that's it

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:07.200
Start from the tail

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:09.079
Scrape along the scales upward

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:10.160
From the tail

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:13.519
Follow the scales toward the head, yes, here

00:17:13.519 --> 00:17:15.000
Use the right amount of force, that's it

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:19.519
That's enough

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:21.480
This one

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:22.680
Alright

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.000
Go weigh it over there

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:25.759
Twenty-eight per jin

00:17:25.759 --> 00:17:26.440
Okay

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:28.240
Fifty-six

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:29.720
Scan the payment code over there

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:30.640
Okay, thank you

00:17:31.519 --> 00:17:34.480
We've got shrimp, fish, softshell turtle, all kinds

00:17:36.519 --> 00:17:37.319
This one

00:17:37.319 --> 00:17:38.720
Yes, this one, this one

00:17:40.519 --> 00:17:41.839
Right, there's a trick to this

00:17:41.839 --> 00:17:43.440
See, the scales are scraped off

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.640
The flesh isn't torn, very nice

00:17:47.759 --> 00:17:48.799
Softshell turtle, right?

00:17:49.559 --> 00:17:50.720
See which one looks best

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:51.880
One hundred eighty, okay

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:54.839
One eighty, just scan over there, thanks

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:56.079
Twenty-five yuan

00:17:56.079 --> 00:17:57.319
Just scan here

00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:58.440
That one

00:17:59.079 --> 00:18:00.200
Is this one okay?

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:01.240
Sure

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.759
Young lady, you worked hard today

00:18:08.759 --> 00:18:09.640
Wipe your sweat quickly

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:11.759
This big fish won't be sold

00:18:11.759 --> 00:18:13.640
I'll take it home later to cook

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:14.000
Thank you

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.400
Boss lady, give me a bigger fish

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:17.000
I want it steamed

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:18.720
Oh, I'm really sorry

00:18:18.759 --> 00:18:20.519
I had a great helper today

00:18:20.519 --> 00:18:22.200
All the big fish are sold out

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:23.640
Only these small ones are left

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:25.400
It's my grandson's birthday today

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:27.000
He's been asking for fish

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.079
See if there's something else for him

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:31.480
Here, young lady, take this home to cook

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:32.559
Thank you

00:18:32.559 --> 00:18:33.839
Sorry about that, sir

00:18:33.839 --> 00:18:35.720
Check out something else, I'll give you a deal

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:38.680
Old sir

00:18:40.319 --> 00:18:41.640
Here, take this one

00:18:41.759 --> 00:18:42.359
How could I accept that?

00:18:42.359 --> 00:18:42.680
Young lady

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:44.319
Isn't this for you to take home and cook?

00:18:45.039 --> 00:18:45.559
It's fine

00:18:46.839 --> 00:18:47.599
That works out

00:18:47.599 --> 00:18:49.279
I'll trade you this bread for it

00:18:49.519 --> 00:18:50.319
Thank you

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:53.720
Oh, young lady

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.200
How are you so kind?

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.640
Pretty face, even kinder heart

00:18:58.359 --> 00:18:59.720
That's really something

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:07.599
Sis Nian'er, Sis Nian'er

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.440
What did you eat? Your mouth is so sweet.

00:19:11.759 --> 00:19:13.599
Break off some bread for us, please.

00:19:16.559 --> 00:19:19.319
Are you trying to catch softshell turtles
with bread?

00:19:19.559 --> 00:19:20.200
That's right.

00:19:20.839 --> 00:19:22.799
Just put the bread on the hook,

00:19:22.799 --> 00:19:24.799
then put them in the bottle, and that's it.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.200
You really know a lot.

00:19:29.359 --> 00:19:30.160
But,

00:19:30.559 --> 00:19:31.920
in this season,

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:34.880
the turtle moms all have their babies.

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:38.039
If you catch a mom,

00:19:38.039 --> 00:19:39.440
what happens to the babies?

00:19:44.119 --> 00:19:46.599
But I think you two are smart.

00:19:47.279 --> 00:19:48.599
I think your setup

00:19:48.599 --> 00:19:50.440
actually works pretty well.

00:19:50.839 --> 00:19:53.920
How about I trade bread with you?

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:55.799
What flavor is it?

00:19:58.839 --> 00:19:59.640
Try it.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:02.960
Mmm.

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:05.920
Thank you.

00:20:17.799 --> 00:20:18.599
Li Zhenggui

00:20:20.359 --> 00:20:21.160
Are you fishing?

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.319
It's a long story.

00:20:27.119 --> 00:20:30.000
I'm going to cheat, I need your love.

00:20:32.799 --> 00:20:33.799
Let's talk at home.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:34.920
What's wrong?

00:20:59.599 --> 00:21:00.880
I've finished my proposal.

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:02.319
When are you coming over?

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:11.240
Sorry, Teacher Zhang.

00:21:11.319 --> 00:21:13.319
Something came up at home, I can't make it.

00:21:13.319 --> 00:21:14.279
Everyone else is busy.

00:21:14.279 --> 00:21:15.319
Some people can't come.

00:21:15.319 --> 00:21:16.599
I told them to work from home.

00:21:16.599 --> 00:21:19.079
Please email me your finished proposal.

00:21:19.079 --> 00:21:20.400
I'll reply to you later.

00:21:27.599 --> 00:21:28.440
Liang Nian'er

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.640
Such a disgusting person.

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:32.519
How do you put up with that?

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:34.680
If it were me, I'd have snapped already.

00:21:35.119 --> 00:21:37.680
You can't avoid people like this at work.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.839
I've dealt with this before.

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.720
So when it happens again,

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:43.680
I try to avoid it as much as I can.

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:45.799
You have to keep a good mindset.

00:21:45.839 --> 00:21:47.119
When you meet bad people or things,

00:21:47.119 --> 00:21:48.359
just let it pass quickly.

00:21:48.359 --> 00:21:49.920
Don't make things harder for yourself.

00:21:50.519 --> 00:21:52.599
Experience more, work more.

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:53.920
Eat more delicious food.

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:55.920
Life will be a bit better that way.

00:21:57.799 --> 00:22:01.880
I've been through similar problems lately.

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:04.000
I've learned a lot.

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:16.599
What's wrong?

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:21.200
I shouldn't have trusted Li Yihan.

00:22:27.319 --> 00:22:28.839
Don't dwell on unhappy things.

00:22:29.079 --> 00:22:31.680
Now it's my turn to love you all.

00:22:52.799 --> 00:22:54.759
Li Zhenggui's longed-for seafood feast

00:22:54.759 --> 00:22:55.920
may be ruined,

00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:58.200
but I believe

00:22:58.559 --> 00:23:01.160
this simple Curry Chicken Rice

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:04.240
can comfort their hearts just as well.

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:23.440
Mix up a versatile sauce.

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:24.839
Use the heat of chili peppers

00:23:24.839 --> 00:23:26.079
to wake up their taste buds.

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:39.799
For a bright green, add some oil.

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:52.559
Two minutes, time's up, take it out.

00:24:06.079 --> 00:24:08.920
Red and green together, pleasing to the eye.

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:20.480
Sauté the chicken until fragrant.

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:44.160
Two spoons soy sauce, one spoon oyster sauce.

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:47.640
Then add some water.

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:54.920
Add fifty grams of curry.

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.559
Pour in fifty milliliters coconut milk.

00:25:14.519 --> 00:25:17.119
Reduce the sauce to the right thickness.

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:20.079
Then it's ready to serve.

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.000
Let's keep it simple today.

00:25:58.519 --> 00:25:59.319
Cheers!

00:26:03.759 --> 00:26:04.559
To dinner!

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:30.799
This is pure happiness.

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:34.319
I remember a year ago when I studied abroad,

00:28:34.519 --> 00:28:36.319
I didn't even know what breakfast was.

00:28:36.319 --> 00:28:38.039
I didn't even know what dinner was.

00:28:38.559 --> 00:28:42.319
But since I met you two,

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.519
I feel dinner is

00:28:45.519 --> 00:28:47.519
something truly precious.

00:28:52.279 --> 00:28:53.519
To Curry Chicken Rice!

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:55.000
Curry Chicken Rice
