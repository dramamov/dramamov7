Teacher Guo

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:38.400
This line from food critic Ego

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.919
is his review of Ratatouille

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:40.919
I think we can totally

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:42.159
follow the direction you just mentioned

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:43.240
and try it again

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.840
It might have unexpected results

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.400
Okay, let's do it once more

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:47.800
I'm ready. All right

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:48.960
Sound, speak

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:52.199
Ready, go

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.439
Not everyone

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:56.680
can become a great artist

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.960
But every great artist

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.479
could come from anywhere

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:02.759
Cut

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.240
Teacher Liang, what's wrong?

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.159
It's not your fault

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:06.759
We have a small issue here

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:07.960
Please take a break

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:09.199
Okay, okay

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.199
Is this maintenance?

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:16.039
I'm Liang Nian'er from audio

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:17.520
There's a leak in our studio

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.240
Can Teacher Gao Lei come over?

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.319
Okay, thank you

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:27.680
Teacher Liang

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.039
I heard you on the phone

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:30.879
Is there a problem with the equipment?

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.080
Let me help you fix it

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:33.479
No need, it's a minor issue

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:34.439
I can handle it myself

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.879
No, thanks

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.080
Nian'er

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.439
To enjoy the best food

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:20.399
I never eat before dinner

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:22.879
Hui

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.120
Hey, why are you still here?

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:30.759
I saw you hadn't come down

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:31.720
I'm waiting for you to get off work

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:32.639
So I came up

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:35.519
If there's something, we can talk tomorrow

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.399
Here's the thing

00:04:37.399 --> 00:04:40.040
Since we ate at your place last time

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.560
I...

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.600
Oh right, I almost forgot

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:44.600
I didn't get to thank you last time

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.519
Now that you mention it, I remember

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:49.920
I was really abrupt last time

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.480
I didn't consider your feelings

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:53.480
The gift was too expensive

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.000
It was nothing, you don't need to be so polite

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.600
I treat you as a friend

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:58.120
That's why I want to thank you more

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.360
Hui

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:11.399
Actually, I've always liked you

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:13.079
I think you're beautiful

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:15.079
You're capable and filial to your parents

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.959
So I... I actually want to

00:05:17.959 --> 00:05:19.040
work with you

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.199
I'm happy too

00:05:29.079 --> 00:05:31.879
Then, that day

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:34.639
Why did you ask me to pretend to be your boyfriend?

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:39.319
Why didn't you ask someone else?

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:41.560
Yihan

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.000
I was a bit rude last time

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.040
I've talked to my parents

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.959
They accept that I'm single now

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.600
And right now

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.000
I really can't start a new relationship

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.480
If I caused any misunderstanding

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.680
I apologize

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:00.360
Here's the thing

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.279
My roommates

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:04.240
They all like you

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:06.319
Especially Zhen Gui

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.800
She says you're a good brother

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:21.800
There's plenty of time ahead

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:34.040
I'm really so unlucky

00:06:34.399 --> 00:06:36.079
I got a huge pimple

00:06:36.079 --> 00:06:37.720
It's ruining my livestream

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.079
I designed so many clothes

00:06:39.079 --> 00:06:41.480
But only sold one

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:44.639
Hui, help me take a look

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:52.600
What's up with you two?

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.240
I got injured fixing equipment

00:06:59.279 --> 00:07:02.240
I hurt myself peeling an apple

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.759
Should've checked the calendar before going out

00:07:08.759 --> 00:07:10.399
Bad luck this year

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.120
Stop gloating over here

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:13.639
Slow down

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:19.199
Give it to me

00:07:19.959 --> 00:07:21.000
Put it on top

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.240
This will help the swelling go down

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:24.680
My foot hurts when I move it

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:25.839
My hand too

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.519
Can't do any work now

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.079
My injury's not serious

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.680
It's medicated and bandaged

00:07:48.079 --> 00:07:49.439
No, Zhen Gui

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.600
Getting a pimple counts as an injury?

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.639
Of course, it hurts a lot

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.560
Come on, you two, cheer up

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.399
Look at you both

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.120
I'm just thinking

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.240
What should we do for dinner tonight?

00:08:07.079 --> 00:08:08.720
What's there to think about?

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:09.720
Of course I'll cook

00:08:09.959 --> 00:08:10.759
No way

00:08:10.839 --> 00:08:12.279
Why not?

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:13.680
My face is hurt

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.000
But my hands and feet work fine

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.079
Don't mess around

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:28.839
Let's just order takeout

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:30.800
I'll do it

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:49.639
It looks okay

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.440
Yeah, it's okay

00:09:02.759 --> 00:09:05.200
This fish was clearly dead in the water

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.679
Then fished out

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.480
Carefully chosen five-star takeout

00:09:22.679 --> 00:09:23.720
I told you

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.639
Takeout is unhealthy and expensive

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:55.799
Please don't forget.

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:57.879
We have a great goal.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.720
My main job is design.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.080
Is there a difference between
design and cooking?

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.120
They're both forms of art.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:08.120
Beautiful dishes can't taste that bad.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:08.919
Not everyone

00:10:08.919 --> 00:10:10.679
can become a great artist.

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:13.720
But every great artist

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.919
can come from anywhere.

00:10:16.559 --> 00:10:17.840
Not everyone

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:20.080
can become a great artist.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.440
But every great artist

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.879
might come from anywhere.

00:10:25.679 --> 00:10:27.840
What are you trying to say?

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:29.600
I've made up my mind.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.639
Ms. Zhen Gui,

00:10:31.039 --> 00:10:33.600
Tonight, be bold and give it a try.

00:10:37.279 --> 00:10:38.399
Darn it, I'll go buy groceries.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:41.960
No way. Even if Nian'er lets you cook,

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:43.919
I won't let you go shopping.

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.000
If you let her buy groceries,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
she'd bring the whole supermarket home.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:50.440
Our daily food budget is only one hundred.

00:10:50.639 --> 00:10:53.480
I absolutely won't let you splurge.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.320
That's my bottom line.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.240
Fine, I won't buy anything.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.879
As a future kitchen master,

00:11:00.399 --> 00:11:03.240
even if there's just one veggie left
in the fridge,

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.840
I can still make a feast.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.120
Alright, we'll use what's in the fridge.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.080
But I have one condition.

00:11:18.759 --> 00:11:20.519
You two

00:11:20.519 --> 00:11:22.480
need to go rest in your rooms.

00:11:22.799 --> 00:11:23.679
Recover, you know?

00:11:24.759 --> 00:11:27.279
Stop hovering and bossing me around.

00:11:27.279 --> 00:11:28.879
Nagging like an old lady.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.039
Go.

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.279
Slow down, my hand's not okay.

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:49.080
Rest up, rest up.

00:12:25.279 --> 00:12:29.200
How to cook beef slices.

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:02.039
Tuna.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.039
That's all we need.

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:17.120
What's the big deal?

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.759
Today I'm making the world's tastiest

00:13:28.759 --> 00:13:31.159
Clay Pot Beef with Chopped Chilies.

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:33.960
I haven't even started yet,

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.440
and you're already making a fuss.

00:16:31.799 --> 00:16:32.960
Zhen Gui,

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:34.759
don't you dare put raw eggs

00:16:34.759 --> 00:16:35.960
in the microwave.

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.600
They'll explode, okay?

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:39.720
Got it, old lady.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:43.480
How's that, old lady?

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:51.519
I know, old lady.

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:28.440
Dinner's ready!

00:19:32.839 --> 00:19:35.720
This is my Clay Pot Beef with Chopped Chilies.

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:39.000
Steamed egg, tuna kimchi fried rice.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:39.680
Dig in.

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:56.200
Ouch, my finger!

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:35.759
It's poisoned!

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:49.240
How is it?

00:20:50.359 --> 00:20:51.400
Looks intense,

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:52.640
but tastes light.

00:20:53.359 --> 00:20:56.799
But it's addictive.

00:20:57.119 --> 00:20:58.519
So you mean

00:20:58.960 --> 00:20:59.759
it's pretty good.

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:17.319
Can you taste a bit of apple?

00:21:18.759 --> 00:21:21.200
Yeah, a little.

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:22.720
Because lately,

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:24.200
she's been saying she wants apples.

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.160
So today I specially

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.920
added some apple.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:37.519
Who taught you this fried rice?

00:21:43.359 --> 00:21:44.400
Does it taste off?

00:21:45.519 --> 00:21:48.079
It has a magical flavor.

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:49.960
Can you teach me?

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:52.279
Secret.

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:01.759
This fried rice is delicious.

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.000
This fried rice is delicious.

00:22:04.079 --> 00:22:06.319
It's good, but don't just pick out the tuna.

00:22:15.119 --> 00:22:16.319
Take the egg

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:19.880
and the rice, mix them together.

00:22:20.279 --> 00:22:22.200
Mix them—super tasty.

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:11.519
Impressive.

00:24:14.839 --> 00:24:15.799
Come on, cheers.

00:24:21.119 --> 00:24:23.880
Cheers to my first time cooking dinner
for you all.

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:25.440
Cheers to dinner.

00:24:35.359 --> 00:24:38.720
What's your secret to making these dishes?

00:24:39.519 --> 00:24:41.759
There is a secret.

00:24:42.119 --> 00:24:43.200
I think

00:24:43.519 --> 00:24:45.039
only rigid people

00:24:45.039 --> 00:24:47.759
follow recipes too strictly.

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:53.920
The world isn't set in stone.

00:24:55.119 --> 00:24:56.440
I think every day

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:58.480
should be lived well.

00:24:58.519 --> 00:25:01.119
Live it colorful and full.

00:25:01.119 --> 00:25:03.640
That's why dinner means so much to me.

00:25:05.079 --> 00:25:08.359
Zhen Gui, I'm honestly impressed.

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:10.799
But,

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:14.279
even though I feel accomplished today,

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:16.759
you should still handle dinner after this.

00:25:18.559 --> 00:25:20.960
When did you get so humble?

00:25:24.279 --> 00:25:25.160
Growth.

00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:27.519
You know, growing up.

00:25:27.519 --> 00:25:29.359
Have you grown lately? You two—

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:30.240
And you,

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:31.720
that guy from your company—

00:25:31.839 --> 00:25:32.680
Yin Zhanqi.

00:25:33.039 --> 00:25:34.400
Isn't he after you?

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:37.160
I think he's pretty good.

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:40.279
How are you two lately?

00:25:46.359 --> 00:25:47.240
Anyway,

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:49.119
I was on a food show before,

00:25:49.119 --> 00:25:50.960
called Meishi Zongdongyuan.

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:52.240
I saw a quote there

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:54.000
that I found interesting.

00:25:54.359 --> 00:25:58.680
It said people always look back,

00:25:58.759 --> 00:26:01.680
never seeing what's ahead.

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:33.039
Turns out, the most hurt today
isn't you or me—

00:26:34.519 --> 00:26:35.519
it's the kitchen.

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.359
And my new Apple phone.

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:43.200
What happened to your phone?

00:26:45.119 --> 00:26:46.160
It fell into the beef.

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:47.519
That's why there's an apple flavor.

00:26:49.279 --> 00:26:51.119
Zhen Gui.

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:55.880
Ah, ah, ah!

00:26:58.920 --> 00:26:59.799
Who cares?

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:01.440
For the most beautiful dinner,

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:02.279
it's all worth it.
