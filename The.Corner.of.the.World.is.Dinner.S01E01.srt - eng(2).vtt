00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:43.519
Morning!

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.159
Eat up while it's still hot.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.400
Liang Nian'er

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:23.400
Cong, what's wrong?

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.400
Are you okay?

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.759
Boss Zhang brought the young streamer.

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:27.080
They're all downstairs now.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.960
Hurry up!

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.960
Turn on your light,

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.280
and all your equipment.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.120
We need to please the client.

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:33.520
It's all up to you.

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:36.599
Always making me work overtime.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.919
And no overtime pay.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.520
Hired me, fired three others.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.400
Mr. Li, may we come in?

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.560
Oh, Mr. Zhang, Mr. Zhang!

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.240
Come on in, come in!

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.599
Let me introduce everyone.

00:03:57.919 --> 00:03:59.919
This is our top audio engineer.

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:00.759
Liang Nian'er

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.680
This is Zhang from Tianhao Culture.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.719
Now, let me introduce

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:09.919
the Star of Tomorrow, Li Zhenggui.

00:04:25.519 --> 00:04:26.959
Tonight, Xiao Zhen's audition

00:04:26.959 --> 00:04:28.279
is in Teacher Liang's hands.

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:34.519
Hao, this studio looks so run-down.

00:04:34.959 --> 00:04:36.480
Are the machines reliable?

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.000
Zhenzhen, this is the best studio in West City.

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:41.720
They do more than auditions.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.600
They've dubbed many big movies.

00:04:45.399 --> 00:04:46.199
Really?

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:53.120
Can we start working now?

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:56.079
Go ahead!

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:06.120
Let's get started, let's go.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.199
Hao

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.079
This engineer looks kind of silly.

00:05:15.079 --> 00:05:16.519
Is she up to it?

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:17.959
People who seem silly

00:05:17.959 --> 00:05:19.360
in their own field

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.480
are unstoppable when they get serious.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.240
Alright, alright, let's begin.

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:33.839
Why isn't dinner here yet?

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:35.079
I'm starving.

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:37.279
No idea what's for dinner tonight.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.079
If only I could cook like Teacher Liang,

00:05:39.079 --> 00:05:40.120
that would be great.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.800
Then I wouldn't have to eat work meals every day.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:42.680
Or order takeout all the time.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.279
Where's Teacher Liang? Still working?

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:44.839
No.

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:46.879
You don't know the client who came today.

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:49.120
Do you know Zhang Haonan from Tianhao Group?

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:49.800
I do.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.399
He brought a young artist today.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.120
Named Li Zhenggui.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.800
I heard Teacher Liang just now in the studio

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.519
gave Li Zhenggui a hard time.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.920
Come, sit down.

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:00.319
Have some water.

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:02.279
Let's do a calibration test now.

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:03.680
I'll count down from three.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.639
Please speak into the mic

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:06.199
and say "testing" three times.

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:08.639
Three, two, one.

00:06:09.399 --> 00:06:10.439
Testing.

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:13.120
Three times, please.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.839
Testing, testing, testing.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.319
Alright, get ready, let's start.

00:06:24.839 --> 00:06:28.920
I came early, no need to hide.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.439
Facing all these plot twists.

00:06:33.399 --> 00:06:37.879
Unclear, blurring real judgment.

00:06:37.879 --> 00:06:39.639
But we have each other's company.

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:44.720
Every dinner eases my regrets.

00:06:44.959 --> 00:06:49.600
Sunlight still shines, bringing warmth.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.160
Will this work?

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.079
Don't worry.

00:07:23.399 --> 00:07:26.680
I came early, no need to dodge.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.560
Facing all these plot twists.

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:34.839
Unclear, blurring real judgment.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.000
But we have each other's company.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.600
Every dinner.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.120
Teacher Liang's skills

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.279
are truly impressive.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.160
Mr. Zhang, let's step out.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.199
To discuss the upcoming schedule.

00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:47.639
Let's go.

00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:52.199
Sunlight still shines, bringing warmth.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.959
That Li Zhenggui,

00:07:56.959 --> 00:07:59.360
first met Zhang Haonan at a bar.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.519
The next day, Zhang said he'd make her famous.

00:08:01.519 --> 00:08:02.199
And now,

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.959
he brought her to our studio to record.

00:08:03.959 --> 00:08:05.000
That Mr. Zhang,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.959
promises to make too many artists famous.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.759
Didn't expect Teacher Liang, usually so patient,

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.399
to be so fierce when angry.

00:08:13.439 --> 00:08:15.000
What tasty food did you order?

00:08:17.279 --> 00:08:19.439
Mr. Zhang said to get Teacher Liang extra food.

00:08:20.199 --> 00:08:21.079
I guess

00:08:21.079 --> 00:08:22.360
Teacher Liang must be hungry now.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:23.319
I'll go bring it to her.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.279
So jealous.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:29.519
That Li Zhenggui, her singing is just—

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:32.240
You have no idea, once the mix is done,

00:08:32.279 --> 00:08:35.279
she even stunned Zhang Haonan.

00:08:42.519 --> 00:08:43.320
Cong

00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:46.480
Can we get paid this month?

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.639
Don't count on Li Zhenggui for that.

00:08:49.039 --> 00:08:51.679
It's fine, pay is no problem this month.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.519
No problem in the future either.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.720
Because Zhang Haonan already agreed

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.039
to sign a three-year contract with us.

00:08:58.799 --> 00:08:59.600
Three years?

00:08:59.879 --> 00:09:00.679
Yes.

00:09:01.519 --> 00:09:04.799
Nian'er, you really did a great job.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.879
It's been three years since your last raise, right?

00:09:08.279 --> 00:09:09.519
You'll get a raise this month.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.919
Cong, you're here too.

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.159
Your dinner is in your office.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.240
I'll go eat first.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:21.080
I'm starving.

00:09:21.799 --> 00:09:22.600
Have you had dinner tonight?

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.279
Not yet.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.240
Go get dinner ready for Nian'er.

00:09:26.519 --> 00:09:28.399
Young people need to be observant.

00:09:34.559 --> 00:09:35.360
Teacher Liang

00:09:36.519 --> 00:09:37.600
Here's your dinner.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.240
No thanks, I need to cook at home.

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.000
Thank you.

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:04.720
I touched it first.

00:11:05.039 --> 00:11:06.279
But I saw it first.

00:11:06.879 --> 00:11:08.919
Then every man you see on the street is yours.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.080
Then if you touch the ATM money, it's all yours.

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:11.919
You—

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:16.519
Boss, please cut it into pieces, thanks.

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:25.919
You're back.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.639
What's wrong?

00:11:39.919 --> 00:11:41.480
Met a crazy lady at the supermarket.

00:11:42.519 --> 00:11:43.919
Who's the crazy lady?

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.519
You didn't buy chicken?

00:11:49.919 --> 00:11:50.720
You're back.

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.399
Little Zhenzhen is back.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.200
So tired...

00:12:01.799 --> 00:12:03.639
That crazy woman stole my chicken.

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.919
How long are you two going to keep
this silent war going?

00:12:08.279 --> 00:12:10.480
I just wanted to help with some chores.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:11.720
Did that bother you?

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:12.879
All this over a few chores.

00:12:12.879 --> 00:12:14.519
You two have been at it for two days.

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.200
We can't let Li Zhenggui buy groceries.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:17.879
Whenever she shops,

00:12:17.879 --> 00:12:19.279
she nearly blows our food budget
for days.

00:12:19.279 --> 00:12:20.279
She spends it all.

00:12:21.279 --> 00:12:23.639
I'm already being super thrifty, okay?

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:32.039
Chef, when are you cooking?

00:12:32.039 --> 00:12:33.919
Little one is starving here.

00:12:44.399 --> 00:12:45.720
Can I lie down or not?

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.000
Preparing dinner

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.919
takes creativity like an artist,

00:13:01.519 --> 00:13:03.320
and the skill of a master server.

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.159
You have to balance everyone's taste.

00:13:06.919 --> 00:13:08.480
And one more thing matters.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.039
Speed.

00:13:10.639 --> 00:13:11.759
After all,

00:13:11.759 --> 00:13:15.039
those two on the couch are starving.

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:17.440
Tonight's theme

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.600
is chicken.

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.720
Two chicken dishes.

00:13:19.919 --> 00:13:22.320
Big Plate Chicken,
Steamed Chicken with Cordyceps Flower.

00:13:23.039 --> 00:13:24.360
Li Zhenggui loves spicy food.

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:25.679
Hui'er prefers mild flavors.

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.240
Start with Steamed Chicken
with Cordyceps Flower.

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:33.480
Marinate the chicken pieces.

00:13:33.799 --> 00:13:35.639
Two spoons of fragrant rice wine.

00:13:35.639 --> 00:13:37.480
That's my secret trick.

00:13:42.879 --> 00:13:44.720
Drizzle oil to lock in the juices.

00:13:52.279 --> 00:13:53.080
Finally,

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:55.320
add fresh cordyceps flower on top.

00:13:56.399 --> 00:13:57.919
Now it's ready to steam.

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:00.559
While it steams, it's time to stir-fry.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:03.039
That's called time management.

00:14:05.879 --> 00:14:07.960
Potatoes, cut into chunks.

00:14:08.879 --> 00:14:10.279
Rinse off the surface starch.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.840
Cut all the key side ingredients.

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:32.480
First, caramelize some sugar.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.440
Caramel gives chicken a tempting
reddish-brown color.

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.039
Don't skip this step.

00:14:52.039 --> 00:14:53.639
That's the sound!

00:14:55.559 --> 00:14:57.799
All kinds of spices and seasonings

00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.200
go in one by one.

00:14:59.519 --> 00:15:02.039
Douban sauce is a must.

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.320
Li Zhenggui's favorite.

00:15:37.879 --> 00:15:39.960
Pour in some beer.

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:43.879
Let the hops bring out the chicken's
sweetness.

00:15:50.039 --> 00:15:50.679
Potatoes.

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:53.720
Bell peppers.

00:15:55.039 --> 00:15:56.000
Piyazi.

00:15:56.639 --> 00:15:58.399
Oh, that's onion.

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.840
Throw them all in the pan.

00:16:01.639 --> 00:16:02.440
Stir-fry.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:06.200
Coat everything evenly with the sauce.

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.720
Cover and simmer.

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:16.240
Meanwhile,

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:18.120
you can prep the third dish.

00:16:20.039 --> 00:16:22.720
Uncover and serve.

00:16:26.759 --> 00:16:29.519
Finally, make asparagus
with mushrooms.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.080
Quick-cooking ones go in last.

00:16:32.759 --> 00:16:34.840
That way, when served,

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:38.039
everything is piping hot.

00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:50.080
Nothing

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:52.399
beats a hot dinner

00:16:52.399 --> 00:16:54.840
for melting away the day's fatigue.

00:16:57.480 --> 00:16:59.000
Dinner's ready, everyone!

00:17:20.759 --> 00:17:22.359
You like spicy? This is for you.

00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:23.759
You like mild? This is for you.

00:17:23.759 --> 00:17:26.000
As for me, I'll take it all.

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:37.759
Let's eat!

00:17:37.759 --> 00:17:38.920
Wait, hold on.

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:54.759
Today, let's celebrate first.

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:58.119
Liang Nian'er got a raise!

00:17:59.319 --> 00:18:00.119
Wait a second.

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:02.599
How do you know Liang Nian'er
got a raise?

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.319
Shh, I'll explain later.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:07.759
To dinner!

00:18:12.359 --> 00:18:13.160
Let's eat!

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:20.319
Delicious!

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:58.920
These potatoes are so good,
try some!

00:18:59.359 --> 00:19:00.480
Are those potatoes spicy?

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:02.319
If they're spicy, hit me.

00:19:06.599 --> 00:19:07.359
Eat.

00:19:13.519 --> 00:19:14.880
I want rice.

00:20:11.079 --> 00:20:12.000
Cheers!

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.599
How is it, Little Zheng?

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:22.440
Pretty good.

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:24.680
Wait a minute.

00:20:25.839 --> 00:20:28.680
Why do you keep calling her
Little Zheng today?

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:33.079
I went to her company for a
voice test today.

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:36.839
Don't you hate going out?

00:20:36.839 --> 00:20:38.839
But I can't stand her boss.

00:20:39.279 --> 00:20:41.480
To cut staff,

00:20:41.759 --> 00:20:44.160
he always piles extra work
on Liang Nian'er.

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:45.680
And no overtime pay.

00:20:46.599 --> 00:20:48.400
That Zhang Haonan—

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.480
He hasn't bothered you again, right?

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:50.559
I'm not stupid.

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:52.200
I blocked him ages ago.

00:20:52.319 --> 00:20:53.119
But you went anyway,

00:20:53.119 --> 00:20:54.680
didn't that affect her job?

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:56.559
Thanks to her,

00:20:56.559 --> 00:20:58.799
I really did get a raise today.

00:21:01.839 --> 00:21:04.079
No, no—hey, you two,

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:06.480
can you stop talking in code?

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:08.400
Can't we just be honest here?

00:21:11.839 --> 00:21:12.880
Here's the thing.

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:14.960
A few days ago, you two

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:18.039
were fighting over Li Zhenggui
overspending on groceries.

00:21:18.559 --> 00:21:21.799
She thinks one hundred a day
isn't enough for food.

00:21:21.799 --> 00:21:23.680
I think the real problem

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:26.240
is our income isn't high enough.

00:21:27.079 --> 00:21:28.000
Especially me.

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:30.279
No raise in three years.

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:32.079
Always working overtime.

00:21:32.079 --> 00:21:33.279
And no overtime pay.

00:21:35.039 --> 00:21:37.240
I guess Li Zhenggui wanted to fix

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:38.359
the problem at its root.

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.680
That's why all this happened today.

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:42.480
Her going to my company.

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:55.079
Anyway, no matter what happens
during the day,

00:21:55.839 --> 00:21:57.680
at night,

00:21:57.680 --> 00:22:01.759
we always deserve the most perfect dinner.

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:04.680
To dinner!

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:11.079
I want to wish—

00:22:11.079 --> 00:22:12.480
Wait, let me finish first.

00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:15.839
I wish for world peace.

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:19.079
May we get raises and make a fortune.

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:20.839
Good health to us all.

00:22:20.839 --> 00:22:22.680
Bigger and better appetites.

00:22:22.759 --> 00:22:26.079
And smooth bathroom breaks.

00:22:26.559 --> 00:22:28.960
We're not done eating yet.

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:30.759
Are you not... smooth?

00:22:30.759 --> 00:22:31.839
I'm very smooth.

00:22:35.079 --> 00:22:36.680
Let me show you something.

00:22:46.319 --> 00:22:48.119
I learned this on a livestream.

00:22:55.079 --> 00:22:55.839
Not bad.

00:22:56.599 --> 00:22:57.480
Join me.

00:22:58.599 --> 00:23:00.480
Go slow, don't fall!

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:11.200
Wait.

00:23:12.119 --> 00:23:12.920
Shh.

00:23:13.119 --> 00:23:13.920
My mom.

00:23:17.839 --> 00:23:19.000
Hello, Mom.

00:23:21.759 --> 00:23:24.359
Why are you calling so late?

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:28.599
Okay, no problem.

00:23:30.039 --> 00:23:31.079
See you in a couple of days.

00:23:31.599 --> 00:23:32.400
Bye.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.839
Why did your mom call you so late?

00:23:35.839 --> 00:23:37.759
Didn't my parents find out

00:23:37.759 --> 00:23:40.279
about me getting engaged to Wang Runze?

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:43.720
So now they're all anxious

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.440
and want to come over and check things out.

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:47.480
It's fine, it's fine.

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:49.279
It means in a couple of days

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:52.079
Mom will come over and have dinner with us.

00:23:52.079 --> 00:23:53.400
And everyone will be there.

00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:56.079
Just bring that person along, that's enough.

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:00.559
Didn't you two break up?

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:06.279
Yeah.

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:10.079
Ah, just let it go.

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:13.480
We'll deal with tomorrow's stuff tomorrow.

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.880
I almost forgot something.

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:31.559
Her, Zhang Hui.

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:33.519
Her parents supposedly hoped she'd grow up

00:24:33.519 --> 00:24:34.480
to be very gentle and virtuous.

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:36.680
So she could marry into a good family.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.400
But things rarely go as planned.

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:40.279
She had a tall, handsome boyfriend.

00:24:40.279 --> 00:24:41.839
They were about to talk marriage.

00:24:41.839 --> 00:24:44.240
They broke up two weeks ago.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:46.839
Just to add,

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:49.559
Zhang Hui works as a trainer at a foreign company.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.079
Not sure about the details.

00:24:51.079 --> 00:24:52.039
It's probably

00:24:52.039 --> 00:24:52.839
like this.

00:24:53.039 --> 00:24:54.839
One, two, three, four.

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:56.960
Over here.

00:24:59.079 --> 00:25:01.480
As for her, Li Zhenggui, from Chongqing.

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:02.839
She and Zhang Hui are childhood friends.

00:25:03.039 --> 00:25:04.240
Except for today,

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:05.480
every time I see her,

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:07.039
she's either lying on the bed or on the floor,

00:25:07.039 --> 00:25:08.240
or on the sofa.

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:09.480
I suspect she's a pampered rich kid

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:10.680
who came down to experience real life.

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.480
Mom, when can you transfer me money?

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.160
I can't buy anything out here now.

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:17.240
It's embarrassing.

00:25:18.519 --> 00:25:19.319
Hello?

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:23.200
Welcome, everyone! Remember to have dinner!
