- You were renting it?

I'm at the bank, you know?

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.100
Your brother
is applying for a loan.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.260
The bank said
your income certificate was too high.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.470
They wanted to verify the information
with your company.

Hurry and discuss this
with your superior.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.810
Make sure they don't find out.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:16.740

so nonchalant about it?

Mr. Fan, sorry about this.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.050
You see, the income certificate
meant for my loan,

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.970
which I requested you to sign,

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:31.937

to verify the information.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:41.970

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:55.660
You see,

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.780
I was the one who recruited you.

00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:59.580
If you're in trouble,

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.410
I'll do anything I can to help you out.

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:03.050
But you see,

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:04.660
you're already married.

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:06.810
You have your own family.

00:07:07.471 --> 00:07:09.179
I know it's a given
to help your brother.

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:10.510
But there should be a limit to it.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:11.810
Don't you agree?

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:14.340
Sorry, Mr. Fan.

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:16.580
I've caused you trouble again.

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.700
Not at all.

It was 1 AM, you know?

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:21.090
Why was she wandering outside?

She has no sense of vigilance at all.

more alert.

I'm not trying
to reprimand the victim here.

But you see,

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:50.860

My goodness. Ladies,

00:09:10.859 --> 00:09:11.859
that's not what I mean.

00:09:11.859 --> 00:09:13.915
- That's not what I mean.
- What do you mean, then?

00:09:13.937 --> 00:09:16.499
- What I said just now...
- Chuchu, here's your lunch.

It's not the first time
I've done it anyway.

00:09:21.515 --> 00:09:22.829
You shouldn't spoil them like this.

00:09:24.515 --> 00:09:26.189
We should be more careful so that people

00:09:26.189 --> 00:09:27.979
- won't gossip about us.
- Put on your shoes.

00:09:27.979 --> 00:09:29.459
It's fine. Just ignore them.

00:09:29.459 --> 00:09:30.459
Put them on.

00:09:31.219 --> 00:09:32.669
You gossip about people all day long.

00:09:32.669 --> 00:09:33.829
A gentleman like you?

00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:35.099
Isn't that a joke?

00:09:35.979 --> 00:09:36.829
Ms. Xia.

00:09:36.829 --> 00:09:39.004
Just summon me
whenever you intend to go outside.

00:09:39.049 --> 00:09:40.309
Isn't that much safer?

00:09:40.309 --> 00:09:41.549
Summon you?

00:09:41.549 --> 00:09:43.529
- That'll endanger me instead.
- What can you do?

00:09:43.549 --> 00:09:46.219
Ladies, you can't
just pick on me like this.

00:09:46.219 --> 00:09:48.026
Ask Zhang and Yuan

00:09:48.026 --> 00:09:49.619
whether they have the same thought as I.

00:09:49.619 --> 00:09:51.549
He doesn't represent
the entirety of men.

00:09:51.549 --> 00:09:53.339
- You see?
- Yuan, it's his personal opinion, huh?

00:10:14.269 --> 00:10:15.309
(Reminder in 5 minutes)

00:10:17.099 --> 00:10:18.549

Sibei.

00:10:24.549 --> 00:10:25.549
My shift is done.

00:10:25.979 --> 00:10:27.069
I need to pick up my child.

00:10:29.859 --> 00:10:31.859
Finish all these invoices.

00:10:34.859 --> 00:10:35.699
I'm getting out of work.

00:10:35.699 --> 00:10:36.915
What should we have for dinner?

00:10:46.549 --> 00:10:47.389
(Ye Sibei.)

00:10:50.379 --> 00:10:51.949
(You shouldn't lead a life like this.)

00:10:58.004 --> 00:11:00.471
How could Wang Lin
transfer her work to you again?

00:11:00.471 --> 00:11:01.499
She skives during the day.

00:11:01.499 --> 00:11:03.449
And, she wants you
to work overtime on her behalf.

00:11:03.739 --> 00:11:05.269
She needs to pick up her child.

00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:06.337
It's just a small favor.

00:11:06.493 --> 00:11:08.099
She needs
to pick up her child every day.

00:11:08.099 --> 00:11:10.471
Don't tell me you're going
to do her this favor every day.

00:11:11.699 --> 00:11:12.859
This is unreal.

00:11:12.859 --> 00:11:14.579
I'll tell her off tomorrow.

00:11:15.069 --> 00:11:16.269
You don't need to do so.

00:11:16.269 --> 00:11:17.949
I'm not in a hurry
to return home anyway.

00:11:22.549 --> 00:11:23.399
Sibei.

00:11:23.829 --> 00:11:25.309
Is your husband not home yet?

00:11:31.189 --> 00:11:32.829
He said he would return tonight.

00:11:35.549 --> 00:11:36.429
I'm glad to hear that.

00:11:37.189 --> 00:11:39.069
Nianwen and I will get married soon.

00:11:39.549 --> 00:11:40.389
I was thinking

00:11:40.389 --> 00:11:42.549
that it'll be inappropriate
to trouble you two

00:11:42.549 --> 00:11:43.826
with my wedding invitation

00:11:43.849 --> 00:11:45.693
if you guys
hadn't reconciled after this.

00:11:45.937 --> 00:11:47.549
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:11:47.549 --> 00:11:49.099
All married couples argue, you know?

00:11:49.909 --> 00:11:51.669
You should head home early after work.

00:11:52.219 --> 00:11:53.909
It's unsafe out there.

00:11:53.909 --> 00:11:54.909
I'll make a move first.

00:11:59.099 --> 00:11:59.939
Chuchu.

00:12:00.979 --> 00:12:02.909
I think you should wear
a longer skirt next time.

00:12:02.909 --> 00:12:03.789
It's so short.

00:12:04.149 --> 00:12:06.149
It'll be dangerous
if you encounter a pervert

00:12:06.149 --> 00:12:07.099
on the streets.

00:12:07.715 --> 00:12:09.269
You see, if we encounter a true pervert,

00:12:09.269 --> 00:12:10.549
what we wear won't matter at all.

00:12:10.549 --> 00:12:11.871
Better to be safe than sorry.

00:12:12.204 --> 00:12:14.026
If not, you should
ask Nianwen to pick you up.

00:12:14.049 --> 00:12:14.915
No need for that.

00:12:14.937 --> 00:12:16.071
I'm as alert as I can be.

00:12:18.429 --> 00:12:19.269
Look.

00:12:20.459 --> 00:12:21.549
What are you doing?

00:12:24.515 --> 00:12:25.982
According to the experts online,

00:12:25.982 --> 00:12:27.829
you need to bring this with you
all the time.

00:12:27.829 --> 00:12:29.699
If you do encounter a crook,
you just provide this to them.

00:12:29.699 --> 00:12:32.004
This way, they'll think
that you won't call the cops on them.

00:12:32.029 --> 00:12:34.099
It'll prevent STDs, reduce the pain,

00:12:34.099 --> 00:12:35.669
and increase the chances of survival.

00:12:35.669 --> 00:12:36.549
Sibei, take one.

00:12:36.829 --> 00:12:37.699
I don't want it.

00:12:37.699 --> 00:12:39.537
- Take it back.
- Better to be safe than sorry.

00:12:39.537 --> 00:12:40.669
I'll put it in your bag.

00:12:41.269 --> 00:12:42.829
Take it with you. I don't need it.

00:12:42.829 --> 00:12:43.909
Don't be shy.

00:12:47.669 --> 00:12:48.699
Is that your husband?

00:12:50.537 --> 00:12:51.271
It's my mother.

00:12:51.337 --> 00:12:52.549
I'll go and get changed first.

00:12:52.549 --> 00:12:53.915
I need to meet another client later.

00:13:04.189 --> 00:13:05.029
Hello, Mom?

00:13:05.029 --> 00:13:06.829
Is the bank asking questions again?

00:13:06.829 --> 00:13:07.829
No.

00:13:08.099 --> 00:13:09.909
Sibei, we received the loan.

00:13:09.909 --> 00:13:11.459
We already signed the house contract.

00:13:11.459 --> 00:13:13.459
Your brother finally bought a house.

00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:15.579
I can rest at ease now.

00:13:15.804 --> 00:13:16.819
I'm glad to hear that.

00:13:17.029 --> 00:13:17.869
Sibei,

00:13:18.029 --> 00:13:20.219
come back early after work tonight.

00:13:20.219 --> 00:13:22.979
I made some cured pork recently.

00:13:22.979 --> 00:13:25.269
I kept the best one for you,
and I'll take it to you later.

00:13:25.269 --> 00:13:27.089
You can cook it for Qin Nan
when he's back.

00:13:27.089 --> 00:13:28.360
No need for that. Qin Nan is...

00:13:29.909 --> 00:13:30.909
What's wrong with him?

00:13:31.909 --> 00:13:32.789
It's nothing.

00:13:33.429 --> 00:13:34.429
He doesn't like it.

00:13:34.429 --> 00:13:36.093
That's because
you don't prepare it well.

00:13:36.115 --> 00:13:37.829
I'll teach you
how to prepare it next time.

00:13:37.829 --> 00:13:38.669
Alright now.

00:13:38.669 --> 00:13:40.029
Come back early after work.

00:13:46.629 --> 00:13:49.949
(Qin Nan)

00:13:49.949 --> 00:13:53.429
(Are you coming home tonight?)

00:13:55.709 --> 00:13:57.669
(Are you coming home tonight?)

00:14:04.549 --> 00:14:06.029
(I have something to tell you.)

00:14:07.629 --> 00:14:08.829
(Divorce Agreement)

00:14:08.829 --> 00:14:09.669
Ye Sibei.

00:14:11.829 --> 00:14:12.909
Let's get a divorce.

00:14:16.909 --> 00:14:18.029
You can have the house.

00:14:18.699 --> 00:14:19.909
I'll pay your loan.

00:14:21.337 --> 00:14:23.309
See if there's anything else
you want to add.

00:14:24.269 --> 00:14:25.429
Let's have a discussion.

00:14:26.829 --> 00:14:28.149
I'll move out by tonight.

00:14:28.149 --> 00:14:29.909
(Divorce Agreement)

00:14:29.909 --> 00:14:31.582
You can take your time reviewing it.

00:14:32.309 --> 00:14:33.189
But why?

00:14:37.549 --> 00:14:38.979
Do you have a mistress outside?

00:14:41.099 --> 00:14:41.939
No.

00:14:42.269 --> 00:14:43.909
If so, why are we getting a divorce?

00:14:48.829 --> 00:14:50.715
If I'm in the wrong, I can change.

00:14:50.715 --> 00:14:52.549
I know that my brother
is a constant bother.

00:14:52.549 --> 00:14:53.429
Sorry about that.

00:14:53.429 --> 00:14:54.269
That's enough.

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:57.149
Let's leave it at that.

00:15:02.149 --> 00:15:03.269
I won't agree to it.

00:15:03.515 --> 00:15:04.915
What's the point of getting married

00:15:04.915 --> 00:15:06.315
if you intend to get a divorce?

00:15:12.782 --> 00:15:14.149
I can't afford to get a divorce.

00:15:16.309 --> 00:15:17.699
Do you see this lamp?

00:15:18.669 --> 00:15:19.979
During our first renovation,

00:15:21.669 --> 00:15:22.979
there was only a bare light bulb.

00:15:24.669 --> 00:15:25.909
I thought it looked ugly.

00:15:26.909 --> 00:15:28.429
But one day, I realized

00:15:30.269 --> 00:15:32.669
that you would make
flower petals out of plastic

00:15:33.669 --> 00:15:35.459
so that you could cover
the bulb with them.

00:15:35.749 --> 00:15:38.382
Standing below the lamp, you asked me
whether or not it looked nice.

00:15:39.789 --> 00:15:40.789
I said it looked great.

00:15:41.804 --> 00:15:42.909
But after that, I realized

00:15:42.909 --> 00:15:44.699
that the plastic petals
were too fragile.

00:15:46.029 --> 00:15:47.149
They kept peeling off.

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:50.982
Whenever that happened,
I suggested that you change the lamp.

00:15:51.471 --> 00:15:53.029
You couldn't bear to part with it.

00:15:54.459 --> 00:15:56.309
You said you could repair it.

00:15:58.029 --> 00:15:59.549
You repaired it day after day.

00:16:00.829 --> 00:16:02.149
And, I waited day after day.

00:16:03.909 --> 00:16:04.909
And, one day,

00:16:06.149 --> 00:16:08.029
there were only three petals left.

00:16:11.382 --> 00:16:13.429
But it's been so long
since you had it repaired.

00:16:16.549 --> 00:16:17.429
I'm sorry.

00:16:22.269 --> 00:16:23.129
Do you think you can

00:16:23.129 --> 00:16:24.979
resolve every issue with an apology?

00:16:25.909 --> 00:16:27.459
That's not what I mean.

00:16:27.459 --> 00:16:29.339
Have you ever considered
your own feelings?

00:16:30.829 --> 00:16:33.099
Have you ever considered
our future before?

00:16:35.099 --> 00:16:35.979
Ye Sibei.

00:16:38.909 --> 00:16:40.549
You shouldn't lead a life like this.

00:16:49.029 --> 00:16:50.509
I won't return again.

00:16:52.269 --> 00:16:53.549
Take care of yourself.

00:17:13.229 --> 00:17:14.069
Ms. Ye.

00:17:14.137 --> 00:17:15.026
Sorry about this.

00:17:15.026 --> 00:17:16.269
I was thinking of cleaning here

00:17:16.269 --> 00:17:17.549
before working hours were over.

00:17:17.549 --> 00:17:18.709
To think that I bumped into your bag.

00:17:18.709 --> 00:17:19.549
It's fine.

00:17:20.269 --> 00:17:21.509
Madam, I can clean it myself.

00:17:21.509 --> 00:17:22.549
Sorry about that, Ms. Ye.

00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:23.389
It's fine.

00:17:28.309 --> 00:17:29.269
Ms. Ye.

00:17:29.269 --> 00:17:31.293
Sorry about this.
I think I'll leave it to you.

00:17:40.509 --> 00:17:43.629
(Time)

00:17:49.859 --> 00:17:52.099
I think it's going to rain soon.

00:17:52.099 --> 00:17:54.469
Pack up and head home
if you have nothing else to do.

00:17:54.579 --> 00:17:56.579
Alright. I'll head home
after finishing this.

00:17:56.579 --> 00:17:58.139
Ms. Tao,
did you bring an umbrella?

00:17:58.139 --> 00:17:58.979
I have a spare one.

00:17:58.979 --> 00:18:00.509
I didn't bring an umbrella.
I'll take it, then.

00:18:00.509 --> 00:18:02.004
There's no need to stand on ceremony.

00:18:03.549 --> 00:18:05.749
Did Ms. Ye argue with her husband?

00:18:05.749 --> 00:18:07.829
Her husband used to pick her up
from work every day.

00:18:09.469 --> 00:18:11.029
It's more than that.

00:18:11.029 --> 00:18:12.499
I'm afraid they're getting a divorce.

00:18:13.693 --> 00:18:15.269
You see, Chuchu is in a relationship

00:18:15.269 --> 00:18:17.049
with her brother, Ye Nianwen.

00:18:17.204 --> 00:18:19.469
He needs to buy a house
as he wants to get married.

00:18:19.469 --> 00:18:21.160
Ye Nianwen only graduated not long ago.

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:22.309
He doesn't have the money.

00:18:22.309 --> 00:18:24.339
Thus, his parents forced Ye Sibei

00:18:24.339 --> 00:18:26.509
to apply for a 100,000 yuan credit loan.

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:27.649
It's 100,000 yuan, you know?

00:18:29.749 --> 00:18:30.939
Ms. Tao.

00:18:30.939 --> 00:18:32.749
How would you know that?

00:18:34.579 --> 00:18:36.269
Ye Sibei needs Mr. Fan's signature

00:18:36.269 --> 00:18:37.829
for her proof of income.

00:18:38.379 --> 00:18:40.339
She requested Mr. Fan
to give her a higher number

00:18:40.339 --> 00:18:41.989
so that it'd be easier
for her to apply for a loan.

00:18:41.989 --> 00:18:43.139
She even requested Mr. Fan

00:18:43.139 --> 00:18:44.309
to not tell anyone about it,

00:18:44.309 --> 00:18:45.419
especially Chuchu.

00:18:46.789 --> 00:18:48.069
Don't tell anyone about it.

00:18:48.069 --> 00:18:49.379
Don't worry.

00:18:50.229 --> 00:18:52.099
It seems Mr. Fan

00:18:52.099 --> 00:18:53.469
has a lot of trust in you.

00:18:55.229 --> 00:18:56.069
This...

00:18:56.509 --> 00:18:57.659
Ye Sibei

00:18:57.659 --> 00:18:59.509
actually agreed to that, huh?

00:19:01.419 --> 00:19:04.029
If I must say, I think
she's sick in the head.

00:19:04.029 --> 00:19:06.115
She's the type of person
who can't turn anyone down.

00:19:06.137 --> 00:19:07.739
She'll get herself
in trouble eventually.

00:19:08.309 --> 00:19:09.149
Thanks.

00:19:38.339 --> 00:19:39.339
Come!

00:19:39.339 --> 00:19:40.509
Who else is here?

00:19:40.509 --> 00:19:41.469
Who else is working?

00:19:41.469 --> 00:19:42.509
Who else is at the office?

00:19:42.509 --> 00:19:44.829
- Mr. Fan.
- Mr. Fan.

00:19:44.829 --> 00:19:47.389
Good. Xiaoyang, Tao Jie,
you guys are still here.

00:19:47.715 --> 00:19:48.669
Sibei is here too, huh?

00:19:49.029 --> 00:19:51.509
Everything's fine
since Chuchu is still here.

00:19:51.509 --> 00:19:52.659
Clean your desks.

00:19:52.671 --> 00:19:54.179
We have a dinner appointment tonight.

00:19:54.179 --> 00:19:55.019
It's a huge client.

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:58.309
Mr. Fan, I already have
a client appointment tonight.

00:19:58.309 --> 00:20:01.069
None of them is as important
as my current client.

00:20:01.069 --> 00:20:02.309
Postpone the appointment.

00:20:02.309 --> 00:20:02.709
Who is it?

00:20:02.709 --> 00:20:04.339
Mr. Zheng of Wanfu Properties

00:20:04.339 --> 00:20:06.509
finally managed to find some time
in his busy schedule

00:20:06.509 --> 00:20:07.789
to have dinner with everyone.

00:20:07.789 --> 00:20:08.659
This is a huge deal.

00:20:08.659 --> 00:20:11.069
I'll give you all a bonus
if we manage to clinch it.

00:20:11.069 --> 00:20:11.749
Wanfu Properties?

00:20:11.749 --> 00:20:13.419
Do you mean the developer of Tianlu?

00:20:13.749 --> 00:20:14.469
That's right.

00:20:14.469 --> 00:20:16.179
Isn't Tianlu
our top real estate project?

00:20:16.179 --> 00:20:17.339
Can we obtain the sales right?

00:20:17.339 --> 00:20:19.339
Whether or not we obtain the sales right

00:20:19.339 --> 00:20:21.939
will depend on
how much you guys can drink.

00:20:22.339 --> 00:20:23.179
Sibei,

00:20:23.179 --> 00:20:24.099
and you all,

00:20:24.099 --> 00:20:25.549
everyone here must attend it.

00:20:25.549 --> 00:20:27.709
If not, you can forget about
keeping your job.

00:20:28.137 --> 00:20:29.579
- This is...
- Let's get changed.

00:20:29.579 --> 00:20:31.404
- Mr. Fan!
- I'll go and get ready as well.

00:20:36.139 --> 00:20:36.979
Mr. Zheng.

00:20:37.309 --> 00:20:39.269
- Mr. Fan.
- We've finally met.

00:20:39.269 --> 00:20:40.829
- Come. Please.
- Sure.

00:20:41.939 --> 00:20:42.939
Come.

00:20:44.139 --> 00:20:45.339
Let me introduce him.

00:20:46.419 --> 00:20:48.789
This is Mr. Zheng of Wanfu Properties.

00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:50.018
He's an old buddy of mine.

00:20:50.019 --> 00:20:52.115
Welcome Mr. Zheng
for coming to guide our work.

00:20:52.537 --> 00:20:53.789
You guys are being too official.

00:20:54.515 --> 00:20:55.789
This is his secretary, Mr. Liu.

00:20:55.789 --> 00:20:56.629
Let's welcome him.

00:20:57.309 --> 00:20:58.309
Welcome.

00:20:58.309 --> 00:20:59.989
Mr. Zheng, over here.

00:21:00.659 --> 00:21:01.709
Go somewhere else.

00:21:02.893 --> 00:21:04.179
Just look at you. Thank you.

00:21:04.179 --> 00:21:05.509
Here, please have a seat.

00:21:06.829 --> 00:21:07.989
Here, Mr. Liu.

00:21:07.989 --> 00:21:09.579
Hey, you shouldn't sit here.

00:21:09.579 --> 00:21:11.789
I don't have an appetite
when I look at your old face.

00:21:12.579 --> 00:21:13.549
You do have a point.

00:21:13.549 --> 00:21:15.560
I'm actually on medication.
I can't drink tonight.

00:21:15.582 --> 00:21:16.509
Meijuan, come.

00:21:16.509 --> 00:21:17.582
- Alright.
- Come here.

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:19.139
- I'll sit here.
- Here, please.

00:21:19.509 --> 00:21:20.789
Hello, Mr. Zheng. I'm Meijuan.

00:21:21.029 --> 00:21:21.869
Nice to meet you.

00:21:23.659 --> 00:21:24.499
Serve the dishes.

00:21:48.949 --> 00:21:55.949
(Workstation 1)

00:21:59.659 --> 00:22:00.499
Nan.

00:22:01.269 --> 00:22:02.419
We're done with today's work.

00:22:02.599 --> 00:22:04.626
You should head home early
if there's nothing else.

00:22:07.099 --> 00:22:07.939
Hurry up!

00:22:08.229 --> 00:22:11.599
(Nancheng City Xuehua Car Wash Center)

00:22:11.619 --> 00:22:12.469
It's so late.

00:22:12.469 --> 00:22:13.789
It's pouring too.

00:22:13.789 --> 00:22:15.709
Why don't you
spend the night at my house?

00:22:15.709 --> 00:22:17.619
It's unsafe out there lately.

00:22:17.619 --> 00:22:19.139
Yeah. I'm quite scared as well.

00:22:19.139 --> 00:22:21.269
If so, let me notify my parents.

00:22:21.989 --> 00:22:23.139
It's pouring out there.

00:22:23.709 --> 00:22:25.099
It's been quite stuffy lately.

00:22:25.859 --> 00:22:26.699
Hello?

00:22:26.859 --> 00:22:27.699
Mom.

00:22:28.029 --> 00:22:29.469
I'm not heading back tonight.

00:22:31.249 --> 00:22:32.639
Jun, I need to go out for a second.

00:22:32.671 --> 00:22:33.699
Watch over the workshop.

00:22:36.099 --> 00:22:38.269
I'll be spending the night
at my best friend's house.

00:22:38.619 --> 00:22:40.659
Alright. Don't worry about me.

00:22:40.709 --> 00:22:42.982
- May our business prosper.
- I wish all of us great health.

00:22:42.989 --> 00:22:44.419
(I have a dinner appointment tonight)
That's great.

00:22:44.449 --> 00:22:46.069
- Those who haven't drunk better drink.
- Yeah.

00:22:46.069 --> 00:22:46.789
Hurry up.

00:22:46.789 --> 00:22:48.099
Mr. Zheng, here.

00:22:48.099 --> 00:22:49.859
For the third toast,

00:22:49.859 --> 00:22:51.093
I have to offer it to you.

00:22:51.115 --> 00:22:53.115
May you be blessed by
the three stars of success

00:22:53.137 --> 00:22:54.269
and rise through the ranks.

00:22:54.269 --> 00:22:55.269
I have to return the toast.

00:22:55.269 --> 00:22:56.099
Come on.

00:22:56.099 --> 00:22:57.026
May you rise through the ranks.

00:22:57.026 --> 00:22:58.271
(I might return late)
May we rise through the ranks.

00:22:58.293 --> 00:22:59.160
Thank you.

00:23:00.619 --> 00:23:01.549
Bottoms up.

00:23:10.749 --> 00:23:11.589
Fan.

00:23:12.099 --> 00:23:14.659
Your employee isn't
showing me any respect at all.

00:23:15.229 --> 00:23:16.069
Who do you mean?

00:23:16.339 --> 00:23:17.549
Who's bold enough to do that?

00:23:17.549 --> 00:23:18.389
That's right.

00:23:20.989 --> 00:23:21.829
This...

00:23:21.899 --> 00:23:22.749
Who is it?

00:23:22.749 --> 00:23:23.589
That's impossible.

00:23:24.049 --> 00:23:25.789
- How could this be?
- How could this be?

00:23:41.789 --> 00:23:42.659
Sibei.

00:23:42.659 --> 00:23:43.829
You should hurry.

00:23:43.829 --> 00:23:45.069
Offer Mr. Zheng a toast.

00:23:50.549 --> 00:23:52.149
Mr. Zheng, here's a toast.

00:23:52.149 --> 00:23:53.029
Sibei.

00:23:53.029 --> 00:23:54.069
You should come here.

00:23:54.069 --> 00:23:55.159
How could you just stand there?

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:56.382
Come here. Do it here.

00:23:56.829 --> 00:23:57.789
Come here.

00:23:57.789 --> 00:23:59.115
Come and offer Mr. Zheng a toast.

00:24:00.204 --> 00:24:01.339
She doesn't know the rules.

00:24:02.229 --> 00:24:03.099
It's fine.

00:24:03.099 --> 00:24:04.099
Let me fill up your cup.

00:24:04.099 --> 00:24:05.099
Alright.

00:24:06.937 --> 00:24:08.269
Mr. Zheng, here's another toast.

00:24:09.269 --> 00:24:11.099
This is the fourth toast, right?

00:24:11.099 --> 00:24:13.789
That means we shall prosper
for all four seasons.

00:24:13.789 --> 00:24:14.989
Liu, am I right?

00:24:15.259 --> 00:24:16.099
That's right.

00:24:16.099 --> 00:24:19.115
May we prosper for all four seasons!

00:24:20.269 --> 00:24:21.229
Look.

00:24:22.749 --> 00:24:24.829
Mr. Zheng, that's too much.

00:24:25.315 --> 00:24:26.829
It's a drinking session, you know?

00:24:26.829 --> 00:24:28.619
Here, let me fill up her cup.

00:24:29.871 --> 00:24:31.604
May we prosper for all four seasons.

00:24:32.671 --> 00:24:33.659
Let me fill up your cup.

00:24:33.659 --> 00:24:34.829
Since there are four cups,

00:24:35.137 --> 00:24:36.379
Mr. Liu, we should join them.

00:24:36.379 --> 00:24:37.829
We should drink one cup each.

00:24:38.309 --> 00:24:39.829
Mr. Zheng, here's a toast to you.

00:24:41.939 --> 00:24:42.989
Fan,

00:24:42.989 --> 00:24:46.229
your company isn't showing me
any respect at all.

00:24:47.939 --> 00:24:49.549
Mr. Zheng, what are you saying?

00:24:49.549 --> 00:24:50.709
This is inappropriate.

00:24:51.229 --> 00:24:52.069
That's inappropriate.

00:24:52.749 --> 00:24:54.309
Here, hand over the cup.

00:24:54.709 --> 00:24:55.549
Mr. Zheng.

00:24:56.269 --> 00:24:57.309
Here's the cup.

00:24:59.859 --> 00:25:00.699
Sibei,

00:25:00.737 --> 00:25:01.739
the cups are on the table.

00:25:02.069 --> 00:25:03.709
Tonight, you represent our company.

00:25:03.709 --> 00:25:05.069
It all falls on you now.

00:25:06.093 --> 00:25:07.693
Ms. Ye, look at this.

00:25:07.693 --> 00:25:09.049
This is a rare opportunity, you know?

00:25:09.049 --> 00:25:10.949
You should drink some.

00:25:10.949 --> 00:25:11.829
Yeah, young girl.

00:25:12.309 --> 00:25:13.379
Everyone's looking at you.

00:25:13.379 --> 00:25:14.859
We can't just let you spoil

00:25:14.859 --> 00:25:15.939
everyone's mood, you know?

00:25:16.309 --> 00:25:17.709
Finish the entire row,

00:25:18.139 --> 00:25:18.989
and Mr. Zheng

00:25:18.989 --> 00:25:20.537
will feel your company's sincerity.

00:25:25.309 --> 00:25:26.419
Mr. Zheng, here's a toast.

00:25:30.379 --> 00:25:31.219
Excellent!

00:25:37.749 --> 00:25:38.829
Excellent!

00:25:39.204 --> 00:25:40.749
- What a great drinker.
- Excellent.

00:25:56.271 --> 00:25:57.829
Are you just drinking it like that?

00:25:58.099 --> 00:25:58.949
Oh yeah.

00:25:59.069 --> 00:26:00.099
Miss,

00:26:00.099 --> 00:26:02.419
don't you think you should
say some greetings?

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.760
Mr. Zheng, here's a toast to you.

00:26:09.269 --> 00:26:10.469
I hope

00:26:11.989 --> 00:26:13.269
you can look after our company.

00:26:13.893 --> 00:26:16.069
We'll definitely provide you
with our best services.

00:26:16.469 --> 00:26:17.829
Please look after us.

00:26:17.829 --> 00:26:18.859
Excellent!

00:26:18.859 --> 00:26:20.449
Provide me with your best services, huh?

00:26:21.229 --> 00:26:22.949
Fan, I have an idea.

00:26:23.069 --> 00:26:24.099
What is it?

00:26:24.099 --> 00:26:25.229
Look closely.

00:26:28.179 --> 00:26:29.269
Excellent!

00:26:32.989 --> 00:26:34.029
- Excellent!
- Excellent!

00:26:34.869 --> 00:26:35.709
Excellent!

00:26:39.189 --> 00:26:40.309
Excellent!

00:26:48.269 --> 00:26:50.671
Excellent! Awkward the first time,
easy the second.

00:26:50.671 --> 00:26:52.659
Since they've already done
a mock nuptial wine gesture,

00:26:52.659 --> 00:26:54.493
don't you think they'll do
the real deal soon?

00:26:54.515 --> 00:26:55.229
That's right!

00:26:56.309 --> 00:26:57.149
Come!

00:26:58.069 --> 00:26:59.029
Come!

00:26:59.899 --> 00:27:01.659
Let me fill up her cup.

00:27:01.659 --> 00:27:03.249
You have to fill up Mr. Zheng's cup.

00:27:03.715 --> 00:27:04.829
Let me fill up your cup.

00:27:47.349 --> 00:27:52.389
(Ladies)

00:28:10.829 --> 00:28:13.709
(Mom)

00:28:16.709 --> 00:28:17.549
Hello, Mom?

00:28:18.269 --> 00:28:19.419
Ye Sibei, where are you?

00:28:25.509 --> 00:28:26.349
I'm home.

00:28:26.829 --> 00:28:27.669
You're home?

00:28:28.229 --> 00:28:29.859
You've learned how to lie, haven't you?

00:28:29.859 --> 00:28:31.069
I'm at your house right now.

00:28:31.069 --> 00:28:32.137
Where are you?

00:28:32.204 --> 00:28:33.915
Look at the time.
Why aren't you home yet?

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:35.582
Mom, I'm working right now.

00:28:35.709 --> 00:28:37.309
I'll talk to you when I get back, okay?

00:28:38.099 --> 00:28:39.339
Do you know what time it is?

00:28:40.226 --> 00:28:41.229
Judging from your voice,

00:28:41.229 --> 00:28:42.659
you must be drinking.

00:28:43.379 --> 00:28:46.099
I'm doing this because of my job.

00:28:46.939 --> 00:28:48.619
How dare you lie to me like that?

00:28:49.099 --> 00:28:49.939
Ye Sibei,

00:28:50.537 --> 00:28:51.982
who are you trying to deceive here?

00:28:52.229 --> 00:28:53.379
Now that you're married,

00:28:53.379 --> 00:28:55.139
you keep everything from us, don't you?

00:28:55.139 --> 00:28:56.859
Do you still take me as your mother?

00:28:56.859 --> 00:28:57.989
(Mom)
How long do you intend

00:28:57.989 --> 00:28:59.859
to keep the divorce agreement from me

00:28:59.859 --> 00:29:01.859
had I not come here myself? Tell me.

00:29:02.469 --> 00:29:04.509
Do you know
getting a divorce is a huge deal?

00:29:05.339 --> 00:29:05.899
Do you know

00:29:05.899 --> 00:29:07.709
what getting a divorce means to a woman?

00:29:07.709 --> 00:29:09.029
You know nothing!

00:29:09.115 --> 00:29:10.339
Do you know how difficult it is

00:29:10.339 --> 00:29:12.149
to get married again
after you get a divorce?

00:29:12.149 --> 00:29:13.578
You should've stayed unmarried
in the first place.

00:29:13.579 --> 00:29:15.649
Why are you getting a divorce
after getting married?

00:29:16.029 --> 00:29:18.069
Chuchu and Nianwen
will get married soon.

00:29:18.069 --> 00:29:18.989
You must consider

00:29:18.989 --> 00:29:20.293
your brother's feelings as well.

00:29:20.293 --> 00:29:21.759
Listen, I don't agree with the divorce.

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:23.382
I'm not the one who wants the divorce!

00:29:24.229 --> 00:29:25.339
It's him!

00:29:25.939 --> 00:29:28.309
He doesn't want
to continue the marriage!

00:29:29.069 --> 00:29:30.829
Was he unhappy about
the loan you took out

00:29:30.829 --> 00:29:32.115
for your younger brother?

00:29:32.419 --> 00:29:34.789
You should talk it over
and coax him, then.

00:29:35.379 --> 00:29:36.859
How can I?

00:29:37.137 --> 00:29:39.439
Does that mean I don't need
to take out a loan if I do it?

00:29:40.069 --> 00:29:41.469
Will Nianwen not buy a house, then?

00:29:41.469 --> 00:29:43.749
Will he not get married, then?

00:29:43.749 --> 00:29:45.469
What are you saying?

00:29:45.469 --> 00:29:47.182
How could you be this insensible?

00:29:47.204 --> 00:29:49.139
How could an elder sister
say something like that?

00:29:49.139 --> 00:29:51.509
What's the point of reprimanding me?

00:29:52.099 --> 00:29:54.309
Do you think I wanted this to happen?

00:29:54.899 --> 00:29:56.789
Do you think

00:29:57.939 --> 00:30:00.339
I wanted to lead a life like this?

00:30:28.339 --> 00:30:29.419
Sibei, are you okay?

00:30:30.069 --> 00:30:31.099
Are you okay?

00:30:36.139 --> 00:30:37.859
Sibei, are you okay?

00:30:40.339 --> 00:30:42.069
I'm fine. I'm totally fine.

00:30:49.982 --> 00:30:51.139
You drank too much just now.

00:30:51.139 --> 00:30:52.989
I think you'll feel better
if you throw up.

00:30:52.989 --> 00:30:54.139
I'm fine.

00:30:54.426 --> 00:30:56.179
Alright.
I'll wait for you outside, then.

00:30:56.179 --> 00:30:57.419
I'll wait by the entrance.

00:31:12.099 --> 00:31:12.989
I'm fine.

00:31:13.509 --> 00:31:14.349
Come.

00:31:19.469 --> 00:31:20.309
Sibei!

00:31:20.737 --> 00:31:22.182
You should sit here for now.

00:31:23.937 --> 00:31:25.509
We can head back after a short break.

00:31:28.029 --> 00:31:28.869
Chuchu.

00:31:31.069 --> 00:31:31.909
Thank you.

00:31:34.659 --> 00:31:35.749
You and Nianwen...

00:31:36.749 --> 00:31:38.749
You two must lead a good life.

00:31:40.419 --> 00:31:41.989
This is my life.

00:31:43.099 --> 00:31:45.179
I don't know how to make it better.

00:31:46.849 --> 00:31:48.404
But you two know how to do so.

00:31:49.939 --> 00:31:52.069
It's good as long as
you two lead a good life.

00:31:52.426 --> 00:31:54.419
Sibei, what nonsense
are you talking about?

00:31:59.509 --> 00:32:00.349
Chuchu.

00:32:02.069 --> 00:32:02.909
Chuchu?

00:32:04.379 --> 00:32:06.339
What's wrong with you two?

00:32:06.339 --> 00:32:08.339
I'm fine. But Sibei just threw up.

00:32:09.139 --> 00:32:10.069
She threw up?

00:32:12.099 --> 00:32:13.139
I'm sorry about this.

00:32:13.204 --> 00:32:14.960
You had to drink so much because of me.

00:32:15.509 --> 00:32:17.419
You rarely attend
dinner appointments like this.

00:32:17.939 --> 00:32:20.069
But this is how
a dinner appointment usually works.

00:32:20.137 --> 00:32:21.419
It must've been tough on you.

00:32:22.829 --> 00:32:23.749
Slowly.

00:32:24.549 --> 00:32:25.389
Mr. Fan.

00:32:26.069 --> 00:32:28.339
Thank you so much.

00:32:28.939 --> 00:32:30.829
I've always been grateful to you.

00:32:31.549 --> 00:32:33.579
When I came here for the job interview,

00:32:33.579 --> 00:32:35.029
they said

00:32:35.029 --> 00:32:36.789
that I was already 26.

00:32:36.789 --> 00:32:38.789
I was going to get married soon.

00:32:38.789 --> 00:32:41.829
And, I might have a child too.

00:32:42.379 --> 00:32:44.029
None of them wanted to recruit me.

00:32:45.379 --> 00:32:46.219
I...

00:32:46.619 --> 00:32:49.509
I don't have much
working experience either.

00:32:49.749 --> 00:32:52.469
I wouldn't even be able to get this job

00:32:52.469 --> 00:32:54.789
if you didn't notify
the HR Department about me.

00:32:55.829 --> 00:32:57.509
- Thank you so much.
- Don't say that.

00:32:57.509 --> 00:32:59.549
Thank you for providing me
with a means to survive.

00:32:59.549 --> 00:33:00.469
Don't say that.

00:33:00.469 --> 00:33:02.099
Thank you so much.

00:33:02.099 --> 00:33:03.469
Please don't say that.

00:33:03.469 --> 00:33:05.939
You've helped me out
a lot at work as well.

00:33:06.093 --> 00:33:07.515
I'm truly sorry today.

00:33:07.582 --> 00:33:09.309
You know
the kind of person Zheng Qiang is.

00:33:09.309 --> 00:33:11.509
I was trying to persuade him,
but to no avail.

00:33:11.899 --> 00:33:12.939
And the project

00:33:12.939 --> 00:33:14.960
we're discussing today
is too huge for us to lose.

00:33:14.982 --> 00:33:15.829
I...

00:33:16.449 --> 00:33:17.859
I have to thank you for this.

00:33:18.789 --> 00:33:19.629
Mr. Fan.

00:33:20.029 --> 00:33:22.419
I may be inexperienced
when it comes to dinner appointments,

00:33:23.709 --> 00:33:24.939
but don't worry.

00:33:25.619 --> 00:33:27.989
I definitely won't put you on the spot.

00:33:28.339 --> 00:33:30.829
- I won't drag everyone down.
- Alright.

00:33:30.829 --> 00:33:32.989
I'll make sure

00:33:32.989 --> 00:33:35.339
all of our efforts
won't go down the drain.

00:33:35.339 --> 00:33:36.379
- Alright.
- Mr. Fan.

00:33:36.659 --> 00:33:37.789
Let's head back inside.

00:33:37.789 --> 00:33:39.982
Mr. Zheng is getting impatient
because no one is around.

00:33:40.004 --> 00:33:41.379
Alright. I'll head back inside.

00:33:41.379 --> 00:33:42.309
Look after her.

00:33:42.309 --> 00:33:43.149
I'll do it.

00:33:43.404 --> 00:33:44.789
- Xiaoyang, help us out.
- Coming.

00:33:44.789 --> 00:33:45.659
Ms. Ye.

00:33:45.659 --> 00:33:46.549
Are you okay?

00:33:46.549 --> 00:33:47.389
Slowly.

00:33:48.939 --> 00:33:49.989
Ye is back.

00:33:50.469 --> 00:33:51.579
Where did she go?

00:33:52.093 --> 00:33:54.149
We'll surely provide you
with our best services.

00:33:54.149 --> 00:33:55.499
Just look at you all.

00:33:55.499 --> 00:33:56.499
Mr. Liu.

00:33:56.499 --> 00:33:57.589
Please take turns.

00:33:57.589 --> 00:33:59.709
Listen, I only want to drink with you.

00:33:59.709 --> 00:34:01.939
Entertain our guest well.

00:34:01.939 --> 00:34:02.979
Don't you agree?

00:34:03.939 --> 00:34:04.779
Slowly!

00:34:06.109 --> 00:34:09.019
Mr. Zheng.

00:34:09.859 --> 00:34:11.379
Here's a toast to you.

00:34:11.379 --> 00:34:13.669
Please believe in our company.

00:34:13.669 --> 00:34:15.715
- Please have faith in Mr. Fan.
- That's right.

00:34:15.715 --> 00:34:18.379
We're surely the best choice for you.

00:34:18.379 --> 00:34:20.499
We'll definitely do our best.

00:34:20.499 --> 00:34:21.499
The best services.

00:34:24.759 --> 00:34:25.629
Alright.

00:34:25.629 --> 00:34:29.709
If so, I'll look forward
to your performances.

00:34:30.271 --> 00:34:31.149
Here's a toast to you.

00:34:32.059 --> 00:34:32.979
Look at them.

00:34:33.669 --> 00:34:34.749
That's not enough!

00:34:40.149 --> 00:34:40.989
Mr. Zheng.

00:34:41.709 --> 00:34:43.149
What about this?

00:34:45.749 --> 00:34:46.979
That's enough, isn't it?

00:34:51.149 --> 00:34:51.693
Bottoms up.

00:34:51.737 --> 00:34:53.499
She doesn't count.

00:34:54.026 --> 00:34:55.379
Mr. Zheng, I already finished it.

00:34:55.379 --> 00:34:56.899
You're playing dirty here.

00:34:58.539 --> 00:35:00.339
Enough already.

00:35:00.339 --> 00:35:01.379
Take her to her seat.

00:35:02.004 --> 00:35:04.328
Mr. Zheng. You're a great businessman.

00:35:04.329 --> 00:35:06.109
They cannot beat you
when it comes to drinking.

00:35:06.109 --> 00:35:06.949
Xiaoyang!

00:35:07.019 --> 00:35:07.859
Hurry up!

00:35:07.859 --> 00:35:08.668
Coming!

00:35:08.669 --> 00:35:10.019
Mr. Zheng has been waiting for you!

00:35:10.019 --> 00:35:11.109
Mr. Zheng!

00:35:11.629 --> 00:35:12.749
Water's here.

00:35:12.749 --> 00:35:14.269
Lady, do you need some water?

00:35:14.269 --> 00:35:15.109
Have some water.
