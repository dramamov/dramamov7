Boss!

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.660
I'm here.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.660
A bowl of congee
and a basket of buns, right?

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.010
- Yes.
- Coming right up!

00:02:23.044 --> 00:02:24.170
Hello, Sibei. What is it?

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.170
I'm working.

(Outpatient Department)

00:02:43.766 --> 00:02:45.380
Excuse me, where is
the gynecology department?

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.380
It's just ahead.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.660
Keep going straight ahead.

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.890
Hello.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.260
Are you Ye Sibei's mother?

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.044
Yes, I am.

00:03:04.155 --> 00:03:05.100
My name is Lin Feng,

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.990
(Police)
with Guantian Precinct Detective Unit.

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:10.450
How is she?

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:11.820
Where is she? Is she okay?

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.660
Don't worry.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:13.890
She's safe.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.660
We got her call around six this morning.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:17.911
She said she needed a coat.

00:03:17.955 --> 00:03:20.380
We found her in a rapeseed field
on the outskirts of the city.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.555
She was hiding in the field.

00:03:21.577 --> 00:03:23.010
None of her belongings were taken.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.690
Her wallet and phone
were still with her.

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.380
But she hasn't spoken a word since.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.540
So, we brought her to the hospital
for an examination.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.177
Our team is still processing the scene.

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:31.940
Processing it for what?

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.940
You just said she was fine.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.540
Based on the scene,

00:03:38.777 --> 00:03:39.980
it's possible your daughter

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.780
was the victim of a sexual assault.

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.220
Where is she now?

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.220
Please come with me.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.220
So far, she hasn't given us
any statement,

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.820
but she did request to be examined.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.260
We've confirmed she has
no other external injuries,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.540
and we've collected skin cells and
tissue from under her fingernails.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.660
She'll also need blood
and urine tests shortly.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.340
Please wait here for now.

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.570
If the tests confirm she was assaulted,

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.540
I'll need your help to comfort her

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.260
and encourage her to talk to us.

(Gynecological Examination)

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:18.410
Officer, look.

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.140
I know my daughter better than anyone.

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.810
She's a good, well-behaved girl.

00:04:23.022 --> 00:04:24.700
There must be some kind
of misunderstanding.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.370
You... You should just go.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.810
Which room is she in?

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.250
It's the room up ahead.

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:31.100
That one?

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.810
Let me talk to her
and get this sorted out.

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:33.660
If we need you,

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.100
we'll call you, alright?

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.100
You can go now.

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:41.210
Mrs. Ye.

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:43.660
Mrs. Ye.

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:44.410
Sibei?

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:45.250
Doctor?

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:46.370
Mrs. Ye.

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:47.850
Doctor, please open the door.

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.100
- Please listen to me.
- I'm the patient's family.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:50.088
- Mrs. Ye.
- Let me in.

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.370
- Mrs. Ye.
- Please let me in, Doctor.

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:53.490
- Please open the door.
- Mrs. Ye.

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.288
- Please listen to me!
- What are you doing?

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:56.533
We won't disclose any details

00:04:56.533 --> 00:04:58.600
of your daughter's case
to anyone unrelated to it.

00:04:58.666 --> 00:05:00.050
What case?

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.540
All she did was ask you for a coat!

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:02.660
What did she even say?
Was there even a case filed?

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.140
If not, how can
there be a case to begin with?

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.980
Please calm down.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.100
You're a woman too.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.930
Can't you try to put yourself
in her shoes?

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.040
- This could affect her entire life.
- I understand.

00:05:09.044 --> 00:05:09.911
We're in a hospital.

00:05:09.911 --> 00:05:12.050
Open the door! I'm her family!

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:13.660
Open it now!

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:14.780
Mrs. Ye, please calm down!

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:15.970
Let's sit down and talk about it.

00:05:15.977 --> 00:05:18.050
You need evidence to
make these claims, right?

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.980
Do you even know
where she was last night?

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:20.220
You don't, do you? Well, I do.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.400
We spoke on the phone.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.810
She just had a fight with her husband.

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:23.660
We talked on the phone.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.780
I have the call log right here.
I have proof.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.311
You need to have proof too.

00:05:27.333 --> 00:05:28.250
I need you to stay calm.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:29.250
Otherwise, I can sue you!

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.250
- This is the hospital.
- I have to protect my daughter's reputation!

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.340
Do you understand?
I don't care where we are!

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:33.810
Please wait
until the examination is over.

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:34.540
Sibei,

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:35.100
it's me, Mom.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.940
Open the door!

00:05:36.111 --> 00:05:37.140
What is all this shouting?

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.220
This is a hospital.

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:39.700
You're disrupting our work.

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:41.620
Sibei.

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:47.740
Sibei.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.220
I'm here.

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.340
Let me look at you.

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.460
Are you okay?

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:00.140
I'm here.

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:01.420
Let's go home.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:03.980
Doctor, I'm so sorry.

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:05.340
My behavior was out of line.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:06.540
Here's the thing,

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.220
could you please give us

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:09.250
all of her test results?

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:10.540
Well,

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:11.810
we didn't file a police report.

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:12.930
We have the right

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:14.340
to protect our privacy, don't we?

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.340
You're a woman,
and you understand, right?

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.355
Even so, you can't just barge in here.

00:06:21.577 --> 00:06:23.866
Yali, take the patient back
to the recovery room.

00:06:23.866 --> 00:06:24.577
Yes.

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:26.700
The physical exam's done,

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.720
but the blood and urine tests
haven't been completed.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.980
You can discuss what to do next
once you've made up your mind.

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:37.340
Thank you, Doctor.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.460
Can't you just let her rest
for a moment?

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:41.980
We have to wait for the results.

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:43.980
- If they confirm she was assaulted...
- What do you mean "if"?

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:45.340
Then this becomes a criminal case.

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.140
You're too young.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:47.220
- You have no idea...
- Mrs. Ye.

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.780
You're a cop. You make an arrest,

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:49.580
- you get your justice...
- We...

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:50.140
And then what?

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:51.660
- What happens to her then?
- We asked you here

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:53.810
- to cooperate with us.
- You'll ruin her life, okay?

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:55.100
We asked you here to assist
us with our investigation.

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:56.460
We're handling this by the book, okay?

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:58.700
We're following the law.

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.140
And this is up to the victim.

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:02.577
This is not your decision to make.

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:05.500
Lin Feng.

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:06.940
Come out for a sec.

00:07:09.888 --> 00:07:10.900
I'll be right at the door.

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.140
Call me if you need anything.

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:29.220
Are you okay?

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:32.140
Are you hurt?

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:34.140
Do you want to lie down?

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:47.020
Did that really happen

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:51.020
to you last night?

00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:58.370
Sibei,

00:07:58.370 --> 00:07:59.900
say something.

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:18.810
Sibei, you have to listen to me on this.

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:20.020
Here's what I think.

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:21.810
What matters most

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:23.700
is that you're safe

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:24.730
and unharmed.

00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:25.810
You need to let this go,

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:26.700
alright?

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:28.490
Let's just pretend it never happened.

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:30.290
Think of it as getting bitten
by a stray dog.

00:08:30.577 --> 00:08:31.977
I don't mean anything else by it,

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:32.850
but you

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:35.370
can't file a police report.

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:38.730
Just tell them you
and Qin Nan had a fight.

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:41.010
Nothing else happened.

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:45.820
What about that jerk?

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:49.060
What matters right now is you.

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:52.060
You have to protect yourself.

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:53.460
We need to keep this between us.

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:54.890
No one can know,

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:56.130
understand?

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:58.250
What about that jerk?

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:00.130
Sibei,

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:03.460
didn't I make myself clear?

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:06.490
No one can know about this.

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:08.444
If word gets out,
how will people look at you?

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:10.370
What about your marriage with Qin Nan?

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:11.370
If your friends

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:12.730
and relatives find out,

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:14.250
what will they think of you?

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:15.460
Your whole life

00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:17.060
will be ruined.

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:19.940
I know this is unfair to you,

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:20.770
but this is

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:23.130
the best way to protect yourself.

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:24.820
Even if they catch him

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:26.130
and lock him up for a few years,

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.644
he will still be released
after he has served his sentence.

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:30.250
What about your future?

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:32.940
Have you thought about it?

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:36.130
I'm doing this for your own good,
don't you see?

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:38.820
Think about it.

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:40.610
If this blows up,

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:41.370
people will say

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:42.130
you

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:43.010
were drunk,

00:09:43.288 --> 00:09:44.940
that you fooled around with someone,

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.010
and that's how it happened.

00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:48.250
It was a company dinner.

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:50.130
I wasn't fooling around.

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:51.130
You're my daughter.

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:53.355
Of course, I believe you.
But will others believe it?

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:55.980
Can we control what people say?

00:09:57.730 --> 00:09:59.100
Gossip can destroy you.

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:02.730
Sibei,

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:04.490
you have to trust me on this.

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:05.850
You must do as I say.

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:07.690
Don't file a police report, alright?

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:10.130
You must be tired.

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:11.490
Let's go home

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:13.610
and rest.

00:10:20.530 --> 00:10:21.370
Captain Zhang.

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:22.130
What a coincidence.

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:23.850
You're here.

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:24.850
Captain Zhang,

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:27.580
I didn't expect to run into you here.

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:29.700
What's going on?

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:31.010
Why are you all gathering here?

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:34.850
Here, Captain Zhang.

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:37.250
What are you doing?

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:38.100
What is this?

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:42.220
You are going to smoke?

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:43.100
What is this place?

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:44.250
This is the hospital.

00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:44.890
Right.

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:46.730
I'm so sorry, Captain Zhang. I forgot.

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:47.340
How about this?

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:48.730
Keep it. Keep it first.

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:49.530
No, I don't want it.

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:51.130
Thank you.

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:53.220
Okay.

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:55.770
So what are you

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:56.610
doing here?

00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:59.130
Captain Zhang, when I saw you
were here today

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:00.370
with your team,

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:01.622
I knew there had to be a case.

00:11:01.622 --> 00:11:02.260
Let me just...

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:04.730
What are you doing?

00:11:05.466 --> 00:11:06.420
I just came by to see

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:08.130
if anyone might need legal assistance.

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:09.250
No, we're good.

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:11.650
Come on, Captain. You never know.

00:11:11.650 --> 00:11:13.130
I don't mind waiting here for a bit.

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:15.420
Leave.

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:17.340
Don't go poking around.

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:18.980
If we actually need your help,

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:20.130
someone will let you know.

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:21.890
Leave now.

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:22.730
Alright, Captain.

00:11:22.755 --> 00:11:24.600
- I'll be on my way.
- Keep your voice down.

00:11:24.622 --> 00:11:26.770
If anyone needs representation,
please make sure to call.

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:28.100
Okay, okay.

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.980
My firm handles all kinds of cases.

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:31.610
Captain Zhang,

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:33.220
- thank you for your hard work.
- Okay.

00:11:34.555 --> 00:11:35.890
I'll get out of your hair.

00:11:49.130 --> 00:11:50.370
You'll get over it.

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:51.340
Stop crying.

00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:16.650
Are you okay?

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:18.730
We should still complete
the blood and urine tests.

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:23.130
I'm going home.

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:25.610
Thank you for bringing me the coat.

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:28.650
I can mail it back to
the precinct tomorrow, if you'd like.

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:29.610
No, wait.

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:32.010
The examination isn't finished.

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:34.010
If you're not feeling any
major physical distress,

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:35.980
it's best to complete the tests.

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:37.610
Then you can come to the station with us

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:39.250
to give a formal statement.

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:47.490
I'm sorry.

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:50.610
I just had a fight with my husband.

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:54.010
It's not something you can help me with.

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:55.010
Hang on.

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:56.288
Even if it was a marital dispute,

00:12:56.311 --> 00:12:57.340
what happened to you...

00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:59.420
Since when do you take a statement
for a couple having a spat?

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:00.650
I've never heard of that!

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:01.730
What's wrong with you?

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:02.570
Come on.

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:04.180
Ye Sibei.

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:05.490
Ye Sibei.

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:06.330
- Ye Si...
- Enough.

00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:07.890
Don't force them.

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:14.650
What kind of mother is she?

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:20.010
We need to file a case.

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:21.370
For what?

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:22.210
Don't be so dramatic.

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:23.420
I'm trying to eat here.

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:28.530
Master,

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:30.370
doesn't today's case

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:31.770
feel familiar to you?

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:34.020
No.

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:37.890
Listen,

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:40.490
don't get into that habit.

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:41.890
The case feels familiar?

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:43.420
No two cases are ever the same.

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:45.010
What I mean is,

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:48.060
the previous case

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:49.711
and today's sexual assault,

00:13:49.733 --> 00:13:50.770
couldn't they be the same...

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:53.420
Who said today's case
was a sexual assault?

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:54.820
Master,

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:56.650
you saw the situation yourself.

00:13:56.650 --> 00:13:59.300
The victim's state was clearly off.

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:00.650
The medical report also showed...

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:01.610
Showed what?

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:07.180
The victim hasn't said anything,

00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:08.180
and you're already

00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:09.180
drawing conclusions?

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:11.770
But her condition...

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:13.420
You're not the victim.

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:15.180
The most we can do right now

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:16.610
is follow the legal procedure.

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:19.610
But what she'll have to face afterward
goes far beyond the legal system.

00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:21.530
So we're just going to do nothing?

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:28.300
Is your workload

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:29.770
too light these days?

00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:32.730
Are you just fixating
on this one case?

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:35.155
That case from the other day
has been stalled for how long now?

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:36.688
Where's your sense of urgency?

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:38.420
Finish your noodles.

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:48.020
No.

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:50.700
Where are you going?

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:53.180
The Traffic Police unit.

00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:55.111
Didn't you tell me to
follow up on the leads?

00:14:55.155 --> 00:14:56.490
At least finish your noodles first.

00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:57.890
What a waste.

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:01.540
What?

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:04.555
I can't believe her.

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:13.180
(Certificate: Ye Ling, 10th Place,
Nan City Outstanding Teacher Open Class)

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:24.530
Why is Sibei back home?

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:26.300
Why shouldn't she be?

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:27.555
She had a fight with Qin Nan.

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:30.010
What was the fight about?

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:32.340
Isn't it normal for couples to argue?

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:33.530
Still, she shouldn't

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:35.490
come running home
every time they have a spat.

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:38.370
A marriage

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:39.940
is like two people in the same boat.

00:15:40.155 --> 00:15:42.220
You've got to communicate,
find common ground,

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:44.530
and work through your differences

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:45.490
if you want it to last.

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:47.980
If you just run home whenever you fight,

00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:49.580
that boat is going to capsize.

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:53.140
Alright,

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:55.010
my birthday is in a few days.

00:15:55.010 --> 00:15:56.460
Invite him over.

00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:57.700
I'll have a word with him.

00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:58.730
Alright, alright.

00:15:58.730 --> 00:15:59.370
Sibei,

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:01.180
shouldn't you call your superior?

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:02.770
You skipped work today.

00:16:02.770 --> 00:16:04.100
You have to tell them.

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:05.750
Tell them you caught a cold
and need to take a sick day.

00:16:05.755 --> 00:16:07.288
Be back at work tomorrow morning.

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:09.130
Hurry up.

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:15.340
(Mr. Fan)

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:22.490
Ye Sibei,

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:25.580
what's going on with you?
You skipped work today.

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:27.530
Even if you're not coming in,
you should at least ask for leave.

00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:28.890
You skipped work without informing.

00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:30.340
Are you planning to quit now?

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:32.300
I'm sorry, Mr. Fan.

00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:35.250
I drank too much last night

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:37.420
and ended up at the hospital.

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:41.820
I'd like to ask for a day off.

00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:44.180
Nothing serious, I hope?

00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:46.980
Sibei,

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:48.530
Mr. Zheng is one of our clients.

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:50.460
I couldn't really stop him last night.

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:52.420
Even if I'd tried,
it wouldn't have worked.

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:53.420
I'm sorry.

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:57.180
It's fine.

00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:00.820
I just can't come in to work today.

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:05.420
Get some rest then.

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:06.940
You can come back to work tomorrow.

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:08.500
Okay.

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:27.260
I'm home.

00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:29.090
Sibei?

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:30.140
You're here.

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:31.420
You're home, son.

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:32.490
Hi, Nianwen.

00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:33.330
You must be hungry.

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:36.180
Who goes hungry these days?

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:37.777
The superiors at my firm love me.

00:17:37.777 --> 00:17:39.420
I'm out at fancy business
dinners every night.

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:41.220
You know, the real high-end stuff.

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:42.570
Honestly, I'm sick of it.

00:17:43.577 --> 00:17:45.650
Don't get so full of yourself, Nianwen.

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:47.180
You just graduated.

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:48.140
You should learn

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:49.940
to keep a low profile at work.

00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:51.140
Mr. Ye!

00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:53.050
Mr. Ye!

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:54.570
You'd better go take a look.

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:55.980
Li and Song are at it again,

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:57.380
arguing over the trash

00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:58.730
by the entrance.

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:00.980
Those two.

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:02.422
They've been bickering for decades.

00:18:02.466 --> 00:18:03.380
They're a handful.

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:05.180
Eat without me.

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:06.133
I'll go check on them.

00:18:06.155 --> 00:18:08.180
Right, the earth
can't spin without you.

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:09.620
Well, they need me.

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:10.980
Go on then.

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:12.330
We'll eat without you.

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:22.940
Sibei,

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:24.180
what brings you home today?

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:34.330
You were at
People's Hospital today?

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:39.460
How did you know?

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:44.660
I saw you there.

00:18:46.533 --> 00:18:48.940
Why were you offering cigarettes
to those police officers?

00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:54.050
I was building case sources.

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:55.660
Think about it.

00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:57.250
Those cops handle cases every day.

00:18:57.250 --> 00:18:59.490
They know tons of people
who might need a lawyer.

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:01.250
If they're willing
to refer victims to me,

00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:02.900
I get clients.

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:07.420
Then why not just wait
at the police station?

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:10.420
I do stake out the station.

00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:11.660
I heard there was a big case,

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:13.570
and the entire criminal unit
got called out,

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:14.980
so I followed them.

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:16.250
I lost them,

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:18.250
but I figured that for a major case,

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:19.844
any victims would end up
at the hospital.

00:19:19.888 --> 00:19:21.420
So I rushed over to People's Hospital.

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:22.900
You have no idea

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:23.940
how long I searched,

00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:25.380
but then I saw three officers

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:26.220
stationed outside

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:27.810
one of the rooms.

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:28.980
And it was right

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:30.180
near the gynecology ward.

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:31.730
My guess is

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:32.620
it's a rape case.

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:40.050
Did you see the victim?

00:19:40.050 --> 00:19:40.980
No.

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:42.770
If I had, I'd be working
on the case right now

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:43.620
instead of being home.

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:45.380
Timing is everything

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:46.620
with these cases.

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:47.490
Any delay,

00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:49.420
and it gets much harder to win.

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:56.250
Are cases like that

00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:58.420
hard to win?

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:02.180
Sibei, think about it.

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:05.420
What are the two key elements
for a rape conviction?

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:06.810
First,

00:20:06.810 --> 00:20:08.900
we have to prove
the objective fact occurred, right?

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:11.620
Meaning, we must prove

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:12.490
that Person A

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:13.660
had sexual intercourse

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:15.250
with Person B.

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:17.180
We can prove that

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:18.420
with biological evidence.

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:19.730
That's the easy part.

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:22.140
The hard part is the second element.

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:24.220
How do we prove

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:25.420
it was forced?

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:26.900
So, let's say

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:28.420
the victim has bruises,

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:29.700
and the defense will say

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:30.730
it could have been

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:31.730
a kink.

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:33.460
There's a video?

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:35.180
They'll claim it was a setup.

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:35.900
Right?

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:38.180
So we need a very strong
chain of evidence

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:39.620
to prove coercion.

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:40.570
And during this process,

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:42.180
those jerks

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:44.140
will throw all kinds

00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:45.980
of disgusting accusations
to protect themselves,

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:46.940
like

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:48.620
that she led him on,

00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:50.810
that they were actually
in a relationship.

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:52.570
That kind of smear can destroy

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:54.420
a victim's reputation.

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:55.330
Many victims

00:20:55.330 --> 00:20:56.420
break down before it even

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:57.260
gets to trial.

00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:05.010
That's why I say,

00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:06.330
in cases like these,

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:07.700
whether you report it or not,

00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:08.980
it's painful

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:10.570
either way.

00:21:10.866 --> 00:21:13.050
Perhaps it's better to just
pretend nothing ever happened,

00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:14.330
and just forget about it.

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:24.570
Can we eat now,

00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:25.410
Attorney Ye?

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:32.180
I'll get the rice.

00:21:40.777 --> 00:21:42.180
Doesn't it taste a little salty?

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:45.020
A little.

00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:05.700
Qin.

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:06.333
Captain Zhang.

00:22:06.333 --> 00:22:07.620
You got the car all cleaned up?

00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:08.420
Yes.

00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:09.090
Thank you.

00:22:09.090 --> 00:22:10.180
I patched up the tire

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:11.180
and gave it a full wash.

00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:12.620
How much? I'll transfer it to you.

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:13.460
Just 70 is fine.

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:17.180
Where'd you take this car?
It was covered in mud.

00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:20.050
Out to the outskirts.

00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:21.380
Must've used a lot of your water.

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:23.900
Alright, I'm sending it over now.

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:24.740
Okay.

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:25.730
By the way,

00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:27.460
your tire's pretty worn down.

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:28.355
If it gets another cut,

00:22:28.355 --> 00:22:30.380
you might as well replace it
instead of patching it again.

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:31.220
Really?

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:34.250
Alright, maybe next time.

00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:35.570
How much is a new one?

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:40.490
For your size, a 215/60 R17,

00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:41.660
you've got a lot of options.

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:42.844
Come take a look over here.

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:47.660
Your original tires were Continentals.

00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:49.090
We've got those,

00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:51.660
but we also carry others
in the same category.

00:22:51.755 --> 00:22:52.620
Like this one here,

00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:53.660
Michelin,

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:54.420
or these,

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:56.140
Pirelli, and GT Radial.

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:57.220
Prices vary depending on

00:22:57.730 --> 00:22:58.940
what you want.

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:03.860
You really know your tires.

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:05.222
You're teasing me, Captain Zhang.

00:23:05.244 --> 00:23:06.250
It's my job.

00:23:08.733 --> 00:23:09.980
Take a look at something for me.

00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:17.980
Check out this tire tread.

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:20.980
Can you tell

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:22.420
what kind of tire

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:23.220
or vehicle

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:24.220
they came from?

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:25.540
Let me see.

00:23:30.222 --> 00:23:31.660
This isn't for an official case.

00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:32.570
It's off the record.

00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:33.490
Just a personal favor.

00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:35.090
- Keep it between us.
- I got it.

00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:44.660
From what I can tell,

00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:46.180
three of these tires

00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:47.620
were replaced,

00:23:47.955 --> 00:23:49.620
and only one
is an original factory tire.

00:23:50.844 --> 00:23:52.955
This specific tire isn't very common.

00:23:52.955 --> 00:23:54.330
Currently, there are only two models

00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:55.860
on the market that fit this pattern.

00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:58.810
One is the new third-generation

00:23:58.810 --> 00:23:59.900
Ford Taurus,

00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:01.570
and the other is

00:24:01.570 --> 00:24:03.380
the Toyota Crown sedan
that stopped production

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:04.420
back in 2013.

00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:08.330
Judging from the wear
on this original tire,

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:10.860
it's pretty worn down.

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:12.420
It's likely the older model.

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:14.930
An older model...

00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:18.330
A Crown?

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:21.380
That car was worth over
800,000 back in its day.

00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:22.460
In Nancheng,

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:23.711
that's considered a luxury car.

00:24:27.244 --> 00:24:29.090
You're good. You really know your stuff.

00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:30.050
You flatter me.

00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:30.980
Alright, I'm going now.

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:31.460
Goodbye.

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:32.660
Okay, my car keys...

00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:33.500
They are here.

00:24:34.244 --> 00:24:34.900
Here you go.

00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:35.570
Alright.

00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:35.980
Thanks.

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:36.460
Drive safe.

00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:37.300
Okay, bye.

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:50.460
Sibei.

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:53.380
Sibei, when you have time,

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:55.149
you should really talk
things out with Qin Nan.

00:24:55.150 --> 00:24:56.730
The longer a couple
lets a conflict fester,

00:24:56.733 --> 00:24:58.066
the harder it is to fix.

00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:00.770
Go home and get some rest.

00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:09.730
You should get some rest too.

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:09.490
You're not drinking!

00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:11.010
Drink with me!

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:12.250
More!

00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:13.250
Give her a break.

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:17.050
Are you okay?

00:26:18.530 --> 00:26:20.860
Liu! Liu!

00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:25.290
(Recently, a missing person case
was reported)

00:26:25.290 --> 00:26:26.420
(on Shanghe Xinchun Street in our city.)

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:27.700
(Nancheng News)
(The victim is a young female.)

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:28.730
(It was 1 AM, you know?)

00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:30.220
(Why was she wandering on the street?)

00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:31.180
(She had no sense of danger.)

00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:32.290
(Don't you think she's trying)

00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:33.420
to seduce someone out there?

00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:34.980
You should go home early.

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:36.220
It hasn't been safe out lately.

00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:38.050
(Keep walking.)

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:40.570
(Count to 1,000.)

00:26:42.530 --> 00:26:44.220
(If you turn around, I'll kill you.)

00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:32.580
(Personal Loan -
Current Payment Due: 2,400 yuan)

00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:16.220
See that gum stain on the floor?

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:17.220
Scrape it off.

00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:18.460
Put a little muscle into it.

00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:19.770
If it still doesn't come off,

00:28:19.770 --> 00:28:21.220
use this spray.

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:23.250
Once it's damp, it'll come up easier.

00:28:23.288 --> 00:28:24.222
You've got to get it off.

00:28:24.222 --> 00:28:25.770
Those black spots look terrible.

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:32.050
I promise I won't make things
difficult for you.

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:35.250
I won't hold anyone back.

00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:37.460
I won't

00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:39.770
let everyone's hard work go to waste.

00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:41.820
Just please,

00:28:42.250 --> 00:28:44.860
make sure you get me

00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:46.940
and Chuchu home safely.

00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:47.620
Don't worry.

00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:50.460
I'll get both of you home
safe and sound.

00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:51.490
As for the floors,

00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:53.730
mop them inside and out.
First with a wet mop,

00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:54.940
then follow with a dry one.

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:57.200
If the floor's slick,
anyone wearing dress shoes

00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:57.980
could slip and fall.

00:28:58.530 --> 00:28:59.370
Sibei.

00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:00.700
You may carry on.

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:03.540
Where's your uniform?

00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:05.540
You...

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:06.980
Why aren't you wearing it?

00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:09.770
You haven't just started working here.

00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:13.220
Company policy requires
you to wear the uniform,

00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:14.060
Sibei.

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:16.260
I forgot.

00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:24.980
Don't forget tomorrow.

00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:30.220
Mr. Fan.

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:31.900
(Fuqiang Real Estate)

00:29:36.770 --> 00:29:37.700
What?

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:40.860
The night before last,

00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:45.220
was it you who drove me home?

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:50.660
Yes, I took you and Chuchu home.

00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:52.980
I dropped Chuchu off first.

00:29:54.288 --> 00:29:55.866
You girls were really drunk,

00:29:55.888 --> 00:29:57.620
but her place was on the way.

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:00.020
Why do you ask?

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:02.900
Did you

00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:04.900
see me all the way to my door?

00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:08.530
You were really drunk, huh?

00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:09.530
Must've blacked out.

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:13.700
My wife called me

00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:14.860
while I was driving you.

00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:16.980
We got into a huge argument
over the phone.

00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:18.420
You overheard and told me

00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:20.460
to just let you out by the roadside.

00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:22.530
So I dropped you off
before reaching your complex.

00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:27.620
What's wrong?

00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:29.620
Is your husband upset with you?

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:37.050
I should get to work.

00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:03.220
Just look at it.

00:31:05.155 --> 00:31:05.980
What are you...

00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:08.290
You startled me!

00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:08.900
What's wrong?

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:09.740
Sibei.

00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:13.490
You look so pale.

00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:14.770
Did you not rest well?

00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:16.060
I'm fine.

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:19.050
Get some rest.

00:31:19.050 --> 00:31:20.620
I got a client waiting.

00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:21.460
Talk later.

00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:22.300
I'm running late.

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:24.820
Chuchu.

00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:27.700
That night,

00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:30.420
did we go home together?

00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:32.940
Yes. As soon as we got to my place,
I got out first.

00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:34.622
Mr. Fan was the one who took you home.

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:37.780
Sibei.

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:39.460
Call me when you get home.

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:40.420
Let me know you're okay.

00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:42.420
I'm going home now. Bye-bye.

00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:48.180
Why? You blacked out?

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:51.180
My memory

00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:52.250
is a little hazy.

00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:53.420
Nothing happened, right?

00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:55.010
Okay, I have to go.

00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:55.980
A client is waiting.

00:32:46.810 --> 00:32:48.380
Did you see his face?

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:56.660
Did he hit you?

00:32:57.250 --> 00:32:58.770
You can't tell anyone about this,

00:32:58.770 --> 00:32:59.810
especially not Qin Nan.

00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:01.940
No man can
look past something like this.

00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:04.420
Don't expect him to understand.
He won't.

00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:06.010
In cases like these,

00:33:06.010 --> 00:33:07.380
whether you report it or not,

00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:09.250
it's painful

00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:10.250
either way.

00:33:10.377 --> 00:33:12.777
Perhaps it's better to just
pretend nothing ever happened.

00:33:12.777 --> 00:33:13.940
Just forget about it.

00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:46.220
Ma'am,

00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:47.090
may I help you?

00:33:48.290 --> 00:33:49.900
Is this Qin Nan's shop?

00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:50.888
I'm his mother-in-law.

00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:52.130
Ma'am.

00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:53.220
Nice to meet you.

00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:54.090
I'm Jun.

00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:55.570
Nan's friend.

00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:57.380
I got to Nan's wedding late.

00:33:57.380 --> 00:33:58.555
So I didn't get to meet you.

00:33:59.244 --> 00:34:00.420
He's upstairs. I'll call him.

00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:01.260
So he's here.

00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:03.180
Nan! Nan!

00:34:04.044 --> 00:34:05.222
Your mother-in-law is here.

00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:06.650
Mom?

00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:11.610
Come on.

00:34:11.610 --> 00:34:12.380
Give me a hand.

00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:13.511
- Mom.
- I see you're busy.

00:34:13.533 --> 00:34:14.400
What brings you here?

00:34:14.577 --> 00:34:15.620
I just want to see you.

00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:18.930
Mom.

00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:20.450
Have a seat.

00:34:22.090 --> 00:34:23.050
I'll get you some water.

00:34:23.530 --> 00:34:24.370
It's fine.

00:34:33.380 --> 00:34:33.900
Mom,

00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:34.740
have some water.

00:34:56.740 --> 00:34:58.570
Someone lives here too?

00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:00.090
I sometimes rest here

00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:01.420
when work gets busy.

00:35:01.690 --> 00:35:03.050
Business must be good then.

00:35:04.530 --> 00:35:05.460
It's been alright.

00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:12.460
Still, it's better to stay at home
when you can.

00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:14.210
You don't eat or sleep well here.

00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:18.130
Look at you, you've lost weight.

00:35:27.130 --> 00:35:28.090
Anyway,

00:35:28.090 --> 00:35:29.980
you two have been married
for quite a while now.

00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:30.740
I've been

00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:32.300
meaning to stop by

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:34.300
but never got around to it.

00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:37.090
Since I happened to be in the area,
I thought I'd drop by.

00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:50.610
I made some braised meat

00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:51.900
for you and Sibei.

00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:52.820
Go home

00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:54.266
and heat it up for dinner tonight.

00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:03.260
Mom,

00:36:04.090 --> 00:36:05.460
is there something

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:06.780
you wanted to talk to me about?

00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:08.330
No.

00:36:09.170 --> 00:36:10.050
Really, there isn't.

00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:14.940
Was there something

00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:15.900
you wanted to tell me?

00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:17.420
Nothing from me either.

00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:27.050
You didn't come over
for dinner last week.

00:36:27.050 --> 00:36:29.050
Try to make it this week, okay?

00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:31.460
Make some time.

00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:32.850
Well,

00:36:33.222 --> 00:36:35.266
if there's nothing else,
I should be going.

00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:36.650
Mom, just stay a little longer?

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:37.380
It's fine.

00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:39.000
I've got tons of things to do back home.

00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:41.090
Remember to heat the food
all the way through.

00:36:41.090 --> 00:36:41.930
- No need to walk me out.
- No, I insist.

00:36:41.933 --> 00:36:42.866
I'm going now. It's fine.

00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:44.010
I'm going.

00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:46.460
How are you getting back?
Let me call a cab for you.

00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:49.090
It's broad daylight
and there are plenty of buses.

00:36:49.090 --> 00:36:50.260
Why waste the money?

00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:52.580
Qin Nan.

00:36:53.570 --> 00:36:55.420
Nianwen's getting married soon,

00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:57.490
and I won't have much
left to worry about.

00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:00.380
Don't you think it's time
for you and Sibei

00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:01.610
to have a baby?

00:37:01.610 --> 00:37:03.610
While I'm still young,
I can help take care of it.

00:37:05.050 --> 00:37:06.490
You should think about it.

00:37:06.490 --> 00:37:07.330
Alright, I'll be off.

00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:29.980
(Reminder in 5 minutes)

00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:37.210
It's time.

00:37:40.570 --> 00:37:41.410
Sibei,

00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:44.900
I've got the invoices and data

00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:46.420
all ready for you.

00:37:47.610 --> 00:37:49.610
Get this done today.

00:37:49.610 --> 00:37:50.820
I have plans today.

00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:54.010
I have to leave early.

00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:56.090
You don't even have kids.

00:37:56.090 --> 00:37:57.780
What do you need to
go home so early for?

00:38:00.090 --> 00:38:01.530
Young people

00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:03.210
should be putting in more overtime.

00:38:03.210 --> 00:38:04.650
I'm saying this for your good.

00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:08.610
I need to get home

00:38:11.530 --> 00:38:12.610
before dark.

00:38:14.570 --> 00:38:16.090
Then finish it before dark.

(Station 2)

00:39:11.010 --> 00:39:14.090
Nan, you've been eating
and sleeping at the shop lately.

00:39:14.333 --> 00:39:16.090
You and your wife fighting or something?

00:39:18.690 --> 00:39:19.530
No.

00:39:20.530 --> 00:39:22.210
Come on, I can tell.

00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:24.740
Since the day you got married,

00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:26.430
have you ever stayed
overnight here before?

00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:28.460
You've been sleeping here for days now.

00:39:29.222 --> 00:39:30.530
What happened between you two?

00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:31.940
You've never been married.

00:39:33.010 --> 00:39:34.210
You wouldn't get it.

00:39:35.355 --> 00:39:36.490
I wish I could get married.

00:39:36.490 --> 00:39:37.460
Who'd want me though?

00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:40.780
After I got out of jail,

00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:42.130
forget dating

00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:43.090
or finding a wife,

00:39:43.650 --> 00:39:44.980
I couldn't even find a job.

00:39:45.222 --> 00:39:48.066
You were the only one who didn't
look down on me and hired me.

00:39:48.130 --> 00:39:49.210
You told me

00:39:49.711 --> 00:39:51.800
that as long as a person works hard,

00:39:52.210 --> 00:39:54.130
they can always start over,

00:39:54.690 --> 00:39:55.900
and something about

00:39:56.570 --> 00:39:57.650
a hurdle?

00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:03.210
So what's this hurdle you and your wife

00:40:03.210 --> 00:40:04.610
are stuck on now?

00:40:05.170 --> 00:40:06.490
Tell me.

00:40:08.644 --> 00:40:11.000
It's not something
I can explain in a short time.

00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:15.490
If a short time isn't enough,

00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:17.420
spend a longer time then.

00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:18.980
You read all those books.

00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:20.488
Surely you can help me understand.

00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:24.460
I've never seen a mechanic

00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:25.740
as studious as you.

00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:28.900
Wait, I get it.

00:40:31.088 --> 00:40:33.090
It's because your wife
is a college grad, right?

00:40:33.090 --> 00:40:35.800
You're scared she'll look down on you,
so you keep studying...

00:40:39.650 --> 00:40:41.210
Did she really look down on you

00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:42.090
for that?

00:40:42.090 --> 00:40:42.980
Get lost!

00:40:43.610 --> 00:40:44.940
Go fix the darn car!

00:40:52.570 --> 00:40:53.780
I remember now.

00:40:54.610 --> 00:40:56.260
That thing you said to me back then...

00:40:57.170 --> 00:40:59.260
It was "There's no hardship
you can't overcome,"

00:41:00.170 --> 00:41:01.010
right?

00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:04.820
Well, now I'm saying it,

00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:06.260
to you and to her.

00:41:07.355 --> 00:41:08.733
Something you should remember.

really choose not to report it?)

Hello, Nan.

Can you come

00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:03.300
to Guantian Police Station now?

00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:04.820
It's Sibei.
