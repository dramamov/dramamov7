00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:20.041
You didn't have to run away,

00:00:20.125 --> 00:00:22.541
Hiro.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.708
You forgot this. Here!

00:00:33.791 --> 00:00:36.333
Your bamboo sword is the one I like.

00:00:36.416 --> 00:00:38.500
I really love it!

00:00:44.041 --> 00:00:46.583
Lee Hana! What were you thinking?

00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:48.500
-Huh?
-You scared me!

00:00:48.583 --> 00:00:49.791
Sorry.

00:00:50.833 --> 00:00:53.458
I went to kendo practice this morning.

00:00:54.541 --> 00:00:56.083
Good morning.

00:00:57.166 --> 00:00:59.875
-M-Morning.
-Good morning.

00:01:03.958 --> 00:01:06.458
Oh, do you have any plans
after work today?

00:01:06.541 --> 00:01:11.416
Wataru wants to grab drinks with us
at Brush before the holidays.

00:01:11.916 --> 00:01:14.916
I'll make sure
he doesn't try to make you sing.

00:01:16.916 --> 00:01:18.458
At Brush, huh?

00:01:18.541 --> 00:01:19.375
Yeah.

00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:27.541
I'm not feeling so good today.

00:01:27.625 --> 00:01:29.083
Sorry.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.833
Huh?

00:01:38.458 --> 00:01:39.833
Good morning.

00:01:39.916 --> 00:01:42.083
-Morning.
-Good morning.

00:01:54.166 --> 00:01:56.750
-Newbie, wipe down the tables.
-Okay!

00:02:19.333 --> 00:02:24.208
SPÉCIAL ORANGETTE

00:02:34.166 --> 00:02:35.833
Um, excuse me.

00:02:35.916 --> 00:02:36.833
Yes?

00:02:36.916 --> 00:02:38.000
This chocolate…

00:02:38.875 --> 00:02:41.416
Is there something wrong
with the chocolate?

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.416
No, nothing's wrong.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.833
It's delicious.

00:02:45.375 --> 00:02:47.083
It's delicious, but…

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.833
It's not the taste I remember.

00:02:51.583 --> 00:02:53.041
I see.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.875
What do you think is different?

00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:02.625
The recipe's changed
since 30 years ago, right?

00:03:03.833 --> 00:03:08.208
Would it be possible to make
a few orangettes like the old ones?

00:03:08.791 --> 00:03:10.000
Huh?

00:03:10.083 --> 00:03:14.500
At my age, it's not unusual
to have a fainting spell.

00:03:15.541 --> 00:03:18.416
It's nothing to make a big fuss about.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.875
Haven't you been working late
again recently?

00:03:23.541 --> 00:03:26.083
Well, the company won't run itself.

00:03:27.208 --> 00:03:30.791
You shouldn't take
orthostatic dizziness lightly.

00:03:30.875 --> 00:03:32.541
A sudden loss of consciousness

00:03:32.625 --> 00:03:36.666
happens when blood flow
to the brain drops.

00:03:38.458 --> 00:03:40.250
But it could be heart-related.

00:03:43.291 --> 00:03:44.458
Either way,

00:03:44.541 --> 00:03:47.583
I recommend you undergo
a full medical checkup.

00:03:48.416 --> 00:03:51.416
Chairman Fujiwara told me not to tell you.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:53.291
How is he now?

00:03:53.375 --> 00:03:55.291
Still being tested.

00:03:55.375 --> 00:03:57.541
Are you sure I don't need to come?

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.041
Please pretend you don't know.

00:04:00.583 --> 00:04:04.291
He probably doesn't want you to worry.

00:04:04.958 --> 00:04:07.291
He's so stubborn.

00:04:07.916 --> 00:04:12.458
He'd go that far to protect his pride,
even from his only son?

00:04:14.666 --> 00:04:15.916
Fine.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.375
It's reassuring to know you're with him.

00:04:19.041 --> 00:04:20.625
Let me know the results.

00:04:20.708 --> 00:04:21.541
I will.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.125
Oh.

00:04:31.083 --> 00:04:34.291
He's still being tested,
but I think he'll be fine.

00:04:34.375 --> 00:04:36.958
Why isn't Sosuke here at a time like this?

00:04:37.041 --> 00:04:41.250
Honestly, it's a comfort
having you by the chairman's side.

00:04:41.791 --> 00:04:43.583
It'd be too late if something happened.

00:04:43.666 --> 00:04:47.208
We need to start thinking
about a successor.

00:04:47.708 --> 00:04:48.958
No need to worry.

00:04:49.541 --> 00:04:51.708
We have another Fujiwara right here.

00:04:52.791 --> 00:04:56.250
Since you're his twin brother's son,
you're practically his own son.

00:04:56.833 --> 00:04:58.041
Isn't that right?

00:04:58.125 --> 00:05:00.083
Please don't say that.

00:05:00.583 --> 00:05:01.916
You're being dramatic.

00:05:04.916 --> 00:05:08.750
What do you mean
by "saving someone with chocolate"?

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.041
My parents were strict when I was a child.

00:05:14.125 --> 00:05:19.708
They wouldn't let me eat chocolate,
saying it was bad for my teeth and health.

00:05:20.291 --> 00:05:23.833
But my older sister saved her allowance

00:05:24.625 --> 00:05:27.500
and bought orangettes for me after school.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.916
That secret taste we shared,
just the two of us, was so delicious.

00:05:35.541 --> 00:05:36.791
And now…

00:05:38.625 --> 00:05:40.541
she's fighting an illness.

00:05:42.875 --> 00:05:44.583
She's in the hospital.

00:05:45.291 --> 00:05:48.916
I want her to taste that chocolate
from our childhood again.

00:05:49.958 --> 00:05:51.291
Unfortunately,

00:05:52.291 --> 00:05:55.041
a lot of time has passed.

00:05:57.375 --> 00:05:59.333
If I can't buy them here,

00:06:00.291 --> 00:06:03.125
I won't find them anywhere, right?

00:06:05.666 --> 00:06:07.750
Time's running out for her.

00:06:10.791 --> 00:06:12.416
I guess there's nothing I can do.

00:06:13.416 --> 00:06:17.583
Thank you very much
for at least hearing me out.

00:06:17.666 --> 00:06:18.500
Of course.

00:06:19.125 --> 00:06:20.625
Excuse me.

00:06:33.041 --> 00:06:34.041
Chief.

00:06:35.833 --> 00:06:37.708
Is there any way to recreate

00:06:38.541 --> 00:06:43.291
the old orangettes
that the customer was talking about?

00:06:44.625 --> 00:06:46.125
For example…

00:06:46.625 --> 00:06:49.625
Do we still have the old recipe?

00:06:54.083 --> 00:06:57.291
Even if Chef Kenji left the recipe,

00:06:57.375 --> 00:07:00.208
I don't know if I could recreate them.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.666
After all, I can't be sure of
how they tasted 30 years ago.

00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:09.958
I might know.

00:07:11.791 --> 00:07:12.875
Oh.

00:07:12.958 --> 00:07:16.666
I used to love the orangettes
from this shop as a kid too.

00:07:17.791 --> 00:07:23.875
It's true the current ones
taste a little different.

00:07:26.833 --> 00:07:28.000
Um.

00:07:29.208 --> 00:07:33.000
Even if there's no recipe,

00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:38.166
are there records of chocolatiers
who worked here at the time?

00:07:39.333 --> 00:07:41.833
Where were they?

00:07:43.541 --> 00:07:45.666
Oh, somewhere around here.

00:07:49.208 --> 00:07:50.083
Here.

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:52.083
Oh!

00:07:57.416 --> 00:07:58.250
Twenty years…

00:07:58.916 --> 00:08:00.500
Chocolatiers…

00:08:01.541 --> 00:08:02.375
Ten years ago?

00:08:02.458 --> 00:08:03.291
HEAD CHOCOLATIER

00:08:03.375 --> 00:08:04.250
Oh!

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:06.916
-Maybe this person?
-Hm?

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.916
Oh, about 30 years ago?

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:10.958
RITSUKO SAEGUSA

00:08:14.458 --> 00:08:15.916
Ms. Saegusa.

00:08:16.416 --> 00:08:17.791
You've got a call.

00:08:18.708 --> 00:08:20.041
Ms. Saegusa.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.500
You've got a phone call
from a place called Le Sauveur.

00:08:25.583 --> 00:08:26.625
Give it to me.

00:08:28.125 --> 00:08:30.291
Ritsuko Saegusa speaking.

00:08:31.083 --> 00:08:33.166
Sorry to call you out of the blue.

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:37.583
I'm Sosuke Fujiwara,
the president of Le Sauveur.

00:08:38.291 --> 00:08:42.291
Oh, I saw the news.
Kenji passed away, right?

00:08:43.166 --> 00:08:46.333
Why do the handsome ones always go first?

00:08:47.125 --> 00:08:49.166
So, what's this about?

00:08:49.666 --> 00:08:50.666
Actually,

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:54.666
I'm calling about a recipe
from 30 years ago.

00:08:56.083 --> 00:09:00.833
We have a customer
who needs that chocolate urgently.

00:09:02.958 --> 00:09:05.416
How much time do you have?

00:09:23.375 --> 00:09:26.500
Good evening.
I'm Fujiwara, the one who called you.

00:09:26.583 --> 00:09:29.583
Sorry for making you come all this way.

00:09:29.666 --> 00:09:33.000
I bet I look older
than you thought I would.

00:09:35.166 --> 00:09:39.083
So, what kind of chocolate should I make?

00:09:40.916 --> 00:09:42.875
Oh, my.

00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:44.958
It's been a while.

00:09:47.541 --> 00:09:48.791
Excuse me.

00:09:56.291 --> 00:09:57.166
Yum.

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:07.541
Hmm.

00:10:08.791 --> 00:10:11.125
You're right. Something's different.

00:10:11.666 --> 00:10:12.833
I knew it.

00:10:14.375 --> 00:10:16.291
What could be different?

00:10:29.041 --> 00:10:30.166
Oh.

00:10:31.041 --> 00:10:33.375
Wasanbon sugar from Awa.

00:10:34.875 --> 00:10:37.541
We used Sanuki wasanbon back then.

00:10:38.041 --> 00:10:42.125
Both are excellent,
but if I had to describe them…

00:10:42.208 --> 00:10:44.416
Awa's has a bolder sweetness,

00:10:44.916 --> 00:10:47.041
and Sanuki's is gentler.

00:10:47.125 --> 00:10:48.541
Exactly.

00:10:49.041 --> 00:10:51.791
Can we get Sanuki wasanbon?

00:10:51.875 --> 00:10:55.333
Yes, but their shop's closed right now.

00:10:55.416 --> 00:10:58.541
Do you still order from Sakaide Company?

00:10:58.625 --> 00:10:59.750
Yes.

00:10:59.833 --> 00:11:01.625
Get their president on the phone.

00:11:01.708 --> 00:11:05.083
-Huh?
-Tell him it's Saegusa the chocolatier.

00:11:05.166 --> 00:11:06.000
Oh.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:07.625
Understood.

00:11:15.125 --> 00:11:18.041
Yes, I'm terribly sorry.

00:11:18.125 --> 00:11:18.958
Yes.

00:11:19.041 --> 00:11:20.875
I'll put Ms. Saegusa on.

00:11:20.958 --> 00:11:22.791
M-Ms. Saegusa?

00:11:22.875 --> 00:11:24.250
No, no, no!

00:11:24.333 --> 00:11:26.250
No need to put her on! Hello?

00:11:26.333 --> 00:11:27.666
I can hear you.

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:30.291
M-Ms. Saegusa?

00:11:30.375 --> 00:11:34.625
Bring Sanuki wasanbon to Le Sauveur. Now.

00:11:35.166 --> 00:11:36.958
Or I'll spill that secret.

00:11:37.041 --> 00:11:38.375
Your company will go under.

00:12:04.791 --> 00:12:05.916
There you are.

00:12:06.625 --> 00:12:10.083
Give me a break, Ms. Saegusa.
You never change!

00:12:10.625 --> 00:12:12.166
You haven't aged a day.

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:15.916
I'm not into younger men.
Just drop it off and go.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.708
What a greeting.

00:12:18.208 --> 00:12:19.125
Thanks, as always!

00:12:19.208 --> 00:12:21.083
Thank you!

00:12:22.791 --> 00:12:24.375
All right, let's get to work.

00:12:24.875 --> 00:12:27.166
I'll teach you,
so just follow my instructions.

00:12:27.833 --> 00:12:29.875
Now, let's begin.

00:12:30.625 --> 00:12:31.458
Yes, ma'am.

00:12:47.166 --> 00:12:48.208
Thanks.

00:13:03.875 --> 00:13:06.250
-You help too.
-Huh?

00:13:07.833 --> 00:13:09.083
Can I?

00:13:12.541 --> 00:13:14.166
Thank you!

00:13:15.041 --> 00:13:16.875
She looks so happy.

00:13:18.541 --> 00:13:19.708
Can I really do this?

00:13:19.791 --> 00:13:21.541
-Of course.
-Really?

00:13:21.625 --> 00:13:22.791
-Sure.
-Go ahead.

00:13:22.875 --> 00:13:23.708
All right.

00:13:25.333 --> 00:13:26.333
You got this.

00:13:26.416 --> 00:13:27.875
Yeah, you can do it.

00:13:32.416 --> 00:13:33.625
Nice job, Hana.

00:13:34.125 --> 00:13:35.208
Really?

00:13:36.791 --> 00:13:38.375
This smells amazing.

00:13:38.458 --> 00:13:40.708
-Chief, isn't she a natural?
-She's good.

00:13:43.833 --> 00:13:45.041
That makes me happy.

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:03.125
You don't squeeze it, huh?

00:14:04.375 --> 00:14:06.375
Like this, right?

00:14:08.208 --> 00:14:11.041
Try to keep it smooth, with no peaks.

00:14:11.125 --> 00:14:12.250
Okay.

00:14:15.666 --> 00:14:16.916
No!

00:14:17.416 --> 00:14:19.583
Not like that. Like this.

00:14:20.083 --> 00:14:21.458
-Sorry.
-Okay.

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:26.416
-Watch closely.
-Yes.

00:14:26.916 --> 00:14:27.875
Ready?

00:14:29.708 --> 00:14:32.500
Like this. See?

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:35.083
Like this.

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:39.041
Just like that. Got it?

00:14:39.916 --> 00:14:40.750
Yes.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.250
-Don't just stand there. Pay attention.
-Oh, yes. Sorry.

00:14:45.333 --> 00:14:47.416
This position's crucial. See?

00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:50.916
It can't be too low or too high.

00:14:53.541 --> 00:14:54.375
Oh.

00:14:55.833 --> 00:14:57.041
After you, Chef.

00:14:57.125 --> 00:14:59.500
Chef? Call me Ritsuko.

00:15:00.041 --> 00:15:01.291
Okay, Ritsuko.

00:15:01.791 --> 00:15:02.625
Go ahead.

00:15:04.708 --> 00:15:06.250
Should I add more ganache?

00:15:06.333 --> 00:15:08.833
You just stand there and watch.

00:15:09.625 --> 00:15:10.458
Yes, ma'am.

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:13.375
Sorry about that.

00:15:36.916 --> 00:15:39.916
Does it taste different from back then?

00:15:43.166 --> 00:15:44.708
I'm sorry.

00:15:44.791 --> 00:15:47.333
After going through
all the trouble of making it…

00:15:52.541 --> 00:15:56.166
Maybe it wasn't just the sugar.

00:15:58.083 --> 00:16:00.083
I see.

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:02.125
It's different?

00:16:03.875 --> 00:16:05.750
It might taste the same,

00:16:05.833 --> 00:16:08.416
but perhaps it tastes different to me
now that I'm grown up.

00:16:09.791 --> 00:16:12.083
Sorry this old lady couldn't help.

00:16:12.166 --> 00:16:14.250
We're very sorry.

00:16:23.916 --> 00:16:25.208
Is it okay if I stop here?

00:16:25.291 --> 00:16:26.708
Yes, thank you.

00:16:27.625 --> 00:16:29.583
Thank you for the ride back.

00:16:29.666 --> 00:16:30.791
Not at all.

00:16:30.875 --> 00:16:34.250
Thank you for traveling so far for us.

00:16:34.333 --> 00:16:36.125
It was my pleasure.

00:16:37.375 --> 00:16:40.583
I hadn't made chocolate in a long time.

00:16:40.666 --> 00:16:43.291
It made me feel 20 years younger.

00:16:45.125 --> 00:16:46.666
Funny, isn't it?

00:16:47.333 --> 00:16:49.333
I'm a shriveled-up old lady,

00:16:49.416 --> 00:16:52.958
but in my heart,
I'm still the same person I was back then.

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:54.625
Me too.

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:58.416
Thanks to the orangettes you made,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.125
I felt like a kid again.

00:17:01.208 --> 00:17:02.500
That's right.

00:17:03.041 --> 00:17:06.250
I remember your father
used to come by often.

00:17:07.875 --> 00:17:11.125
Even though he managed
a big confectionery company,

00:17:11.625 --> 00:17:17.000
he'd always buy a ton,
saying he wanted his precious son

00:17:17.083 --> 00:17:19.041
to have handmade chocolate.

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:22.750
You've grown into such a fine man.

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:25.083
I'm glad to see

00:17:26.125 --> 00:17:29.750
Le Sauveur is still in good hands.

00:17:41.458 --> 00:17:43.333
It's too bad.

00:17:43.958 --> 00:17:46.083
I was hoping things would work out.

00:17:49.416 --> 00:17:53.208
Still, isn't it great you've grown
into a fine man, Mr. Director?

00:17:55.375 --> 00:17:57.375
That wasn't about me.

00:18:00.625 --> 00:18:04.125
It was about my older brother, actually.

00:18:07.291 --> 00:18:12.541
He was frail
and didn't have much of an appetite.

00:18:13.583 --> 00:18:17.958
My father always bought him
his favorite orangettes.

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:23.208
He'd tell my brother
they were "energy balls."

00:18:24.583 --> 00:18:29.291
As a kid, I was so jealous of that.

00:18:31.416 --> 00:18:36.041
When I begged for some,
he'd scold me for being spoiled.

00:18:39.708 --> 00:18:40.958
One day,

00:18:41.916 --> 00:18:45.791
my brother secretly gave me
the chocolate he'd saved.

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:49.250
To me, back then,

00:18:50.083 --> 00:18:52.500
it was the best thing I'd ever tasted.

00:18:55.875 --> 00:18:59.875
That's why you worked so hard, didn't you?

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:05.041
You understood Reiko's feelings
better than anyone.

00:19:11.083 --> 00:19:12.833
In my case…

00:19:15.541 --> 00:19:21.250
I selfishly took away
my brother's favorite chocolate.

00:19:24.083 --> 00:19:26.625
I was a clueless, lousy little brother.

00:19:29.416 --> 00:19:30.916
Giving chocolate to someone

00:19:32.041 --> 00:19:34.166
doesn't just make the other person happy.

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:36.708
It makes you happy too, doesn't it?

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000
I'm sure your brother was very happy

00:19:43.083 --> 00:19:46.208
to see the smile on your face.

00:19:47.916 --> 00:19:49.333
That's why

00:19:50.375 --> 00:19:54.375
I think you were
a really good little brother.

00:19:57.208 --> 00:19:58.250
You think so?

00:19:58.791 --> 00:19:59.625
I do.

00:20:02.083 --> 00:20:04.000
Wait a minute!

00:20:06.541 --> 00:20:08.375
I just remembered.

00:20:08.875 --> 00:20:10.333
I remember now.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.833
The Spécial Orangette made just for kids.

00:20:14.333 --> 00:20:19.083
There was a special recipe
that was created thanks to your father.

00:20:35.291 --> 00:20:36.708
Oh, you're here.

00:20:38.791 --> 00:20:42.375
Here, just like you asked.
They're ready to go.

00:20:43.833 --> 00:20:46.125
Sorry to trouble you all the time.

00:20:46.208 --> 00:20:49.708
My eldest son can only eat
chocolates from this shop.

00:20:50.916 --> 00:20:53.166
Well, thanks to your idea,

00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:58.583
we're thinking of selling
healthy chocolate for kids.

00:20:59.333 --> 00:21:00.416
What do you think?

00:21:11.416 --> 00:21:12.375
Here you go.

00:21:12.958 --> 00:21:14.208
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

00:21:14.291 --> 00:21:15.666
Yay!

00:21:16.333 --> 00:21:17.958
Thanks.

00:21:55.416 --> 00:21:58.958
Apparently, they used soy milk
instead of fresh cream.

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:05.208
Consuming the iron in soy milk
together with the vitamin C in oranges

00:22:05.291 --> 00:22:07.291
is good for the body, it seems.

00:22:08.166 --> 00:22:11.416
They used to make
special orangettes for kids.

00:22:13.041 --> 00:22:14.541
Sorry to ask this,

00:22:14.625 --> 00:22:18.041
but could you make them one more time?

00:22:18.125 --> 00:22:19.500
-Of course!
-Of course!

00:22:20.333 --> 00:22:22.083
Leave it to us.

00:22:22.166 --> 00:22:23.041
All right.

00:22:40.041 --> 00:22:41.250
Um…

00:22:43.583 --> 00:22:46.000
Before your misunderstanding escalates,

00:22:46.791 --> 00:22:49.000
there's something I need to tell you.

00:22:52.833 --> 00:22:54.083
So, uh…

00:22:56.833 --> 00:23:01.458
I didn't mean to listen on purpose, but…

00:23:03.458 --> 00:23:04.625
Actually…

00:23:07.166 --> 00:23:09.625
I was the one at the kendo dojo.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000
Um…

00:23:14.333 --> 00:23:16.750
It's a long story.

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:19.750
But anyway,

00:23:20.916 --> 00:23:23.625
your love confession didn't actually fail.

00:23:26.833 --> 00:23:29.958
Hiro's a really good guy.

00:23:31.125 --> 00:23:32.375
So, you should try…

00:23:38.291 --> 00:23:39.666
Hana?

00:23:42.916 --> 00:23:43.750
Ha--

00:23:59.583 --> 00:24:01.916
I told you, okay?

00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:06.375
You just didn't hear
because you were asleep.

00:24:18.666 --> 00:24:21.875
My heart was always trembling

00:24:21.958 --> 00:24:27.000
If I see you smile

00:24:27.083 --> 00:24:31.250
I'm afraid our relationship
Might become awkward

00:24:31.333 --> 00:24:32.416
"CONFESSION"

00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:37.458
I couldn't say anything

00:24:37.541 --> 00:24:44.375
So I turned away,
Tears flowing down my face

00:24:44.875 --> 00:24:48.208
I want to tell you how I feel

00:24:48.291 --> 00:24:50.625
But when you're near

00:24:50.708 --> 00:24:53.250
I can't say a word

00:24:53.333 --> 00:24:55.875
I'm starting to hate that about myself

00:24:55.958 --> 00:24:58.541
I need to be brave

00:24:58.625 --> 00:25:01.791
So I won't have regrets

00:25:01.875 --> 00:25:06.083
Little by little, I'll get closer to you

00:25:06.166 --> 00:25:09.291
And I'll confess

00:25:09.375 --> 00:25:11.875
That I love you

00:25:11.958 --> 00:25:16.958
I can't say a word
I hate that about myself

00:25:17.041 --> 00:25:19.708
I need to be brave

00:25:19.791 --> 00:25:22.500
So I won't have regrets

00:25:22.583 --> 00:25:27.333
Little by little, I'll get closer to you

00:25:27.416 --> 00:25:32.625
And I'll confess

00:25:35.291 --> 00:25:36.875
Here, try one.

00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:06.375
It's delicious.

00:26:09.375 --> 00:26:11.875
Tastes just like before.

00:26:13.041 --> 00:26:14.750
No, even better.

00:26:26.083 --> 00:26:27.666
Thank you.

00:26:28.208 --> 00:26:30.625
I can't believe you bought these for me.

00:26:32.208 --> 00:26:35.500
You've grown up, Reiko.

00:26:36.583 --> 00:26:39.333
I've been a grown-up for a while.

00:26:40.541 --> 00:26:43.666
I'm not a little girl
waiting for chocolate anymore.

00:26:44.583 --> 00:26:46.750
Have one too.

00:26:58.375 --> 00:26:59.708
It's so good.

00:27:21.416 --> 00:27:22.625
I…

00:27:24.041 --> 00:27:26.666
have this urge to steal.

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:29.541
But…

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:33.833
I…

00:27:34.958 --> 00:27:36.625
I want to change!

00:27:37.916 --> 00:27:40.541
I've found someone

00:27:42.375 --> 00:27:43.833
I truly love.

00:27:45.375 --> 00:27:49.166
So I want to be someone
I'm not ashamed of.

00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:50.916
If I have flaws,

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.625
I'll swallow my pride
and try to fix them all.

00:27:58.916 --> 00:28:01.250
Before my baby is born.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000
I think I understand how you feel.

00:28:06.083 --> 00:28:07.750
You have kleptomania too?

00:28:08.333 --> 00:28:10.708
Huh? No, not that.

00:28:11.375 --> 00:28:12.708
I meant

00:28:12.791 --> 00:28:16.708
the feeling of wanting
to change for someone.

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:21.833
I think it takes courage to change.

00:28:23.208 --> 00:28:28.125
And your courage
will definitely bring good change.

00:28:40.833 --> 00:28:43.250
To change myself…

00:28:55.458 --> 00:28:59.166
-Huh? F-From the hostess club…
-Is Yuri your favorite hostess?

00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:02.000
Uh, I thought I'd lost these.

00:29:03.375 --> 00:29:04.666
They were on the floor.

00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:06.916
-Th-Thank you.
-I found them.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:07.958
Doctor.

00:29:08.625 --> 00:29:09.666
I'll start

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:14.666
by practicing giving back items
I found to their owners.

00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:21.833
Oh, that's mine.

00:29:21.916 --> 00:29:24.583
Oh! I found it on the floor.

00:29:24.666 --> 00:29:26.250
Uh, thanks.

00:29:27.583 --> 00:29:29.083
Hey, that's my glove.

00:29:29.583 --> 00:29:30.625
-Huh?
-Oh?

00:29:30.708 --> 00:29:31.708
When did you…

00:29:32.666 --> 00:29:33.708
Found it there.

00:29:33.791 --> 00:29:35.500
-There?
-Yes.

00:29:35.583 --> 00:29:36.666
-Huh?
-Good for you.

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:37.666
Wow!

00:29:38.458 --> 00:29:40.416
You won!

00:29:41.083 --> 00:29:41.916
You ate it?

00:29:42.416 --> 00:29:43.666
I ate it.

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:45.875
Just kidding. It was on the floor.

00:29:46.625 --> 00:29:48.666
Lucky you. Score!

00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:50.500
Y-Yeah, score.

00:29:53.333 --> 00:29:55.791
Huh? W-Wait, how?

00:29:55.875 --> 00:29:58.375
-Huh? That's mine!
-Oh…

00:29:58.458 --> 00:29:59.375
What about me?

00:30:04.541 --> 00:30:06.958
-Thank you!
-I'm happy for you.

00:30:07.041 --> 00:30:08.666
-Yes.
-I'm so glad.

00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:10.750
Here, Mr. Luxury Tuna.

00:30:13.916 --> 00:30:15.083
If you'd like,

00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:17.125
please keep it.

00:30:18.416 --> 00:30:21.791
As thanks for your courage today.

00:30:22.333 --> 00:30:23.166
Huh?

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:28.250
Thank you so much.

00:30:28.333 --> 00:30:30.583
So, who made you want to change?

00:30:31.166 --> 00:30:32.541
Was it Miracle Touch?

00:30:32.625 --> 00:30:34.125
What are you talking about?

00:30:34.208 --> 00:30:36.375
I told you, she likes someone else.

00:30:36.458 --> 00:30:39.750
You're all flustered. So fishy!

00:30:41.125 --> 00:30:44.958
Hey, buy me a drink,
and I'll listen to you as a friend.

00:30:45.041 --> 00:30:47.625
I'll buy you a drink, so don't ask.

00:30:49.625 --> 00:30:51.541
Fine. Where should we go?

00:30:52.291 --> 00:30:56.416
Can I trust my friend
and drink until I drop for once?

00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:58.541
I bet you always drink till you drop.

00:30:58.625 --> 00:30:59.583
Pick a place.

00:31:00.083 --> 00:31:01.250
Yeah, yeah.

00:31:28.416 --> 00:31:30.791
He can't do kendo
without his bamboo sword.

00:31:31.625 --> 00:31:34.250
Right? Yeah.

00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:37.708
I'll just quietly drop it off.

00:31:50.958 --> 00:31:53.500
We're here. Go on in. I'll park the car.

00:31:53.583 --> 00:31:55.500
Got it. Thanks.

00:31:56.958 --> 00:31:57.875
All right.

00:32:09.416 --> 00:32:10.625
Huh?

00:32:11.833 --> 00:32:12.666
Wait.

00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:15.125
Hold on.

00:32:31.083 --> 00:32:33.458
No, this is really a coincidence.

00:32:34.166 --> 00:32:37.041
I came here by mistake.

00:32:39.916 --> 00:32:40.750
A coincidence?

00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:43.500
Yeah, exactly.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.125
So it doesn't mean anything.

00:32:46.208 --> 00:32:47.041
Okay, bye.

00:32:47.708 --> 00:32:48.791
Your coat.

00:32:51.041 --> 00:32:52.666
Do you mind taking it back?

00:32:54.791 --> 00:32:57.500
So there won't be any more "coincidences."

00:32:59.916 --> 00:33:01.250
I'll take it back.

00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:28.583
Your coat's over there.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.583
Are you mad?

00:33:38.458 --> 00:33:39.500
At me?

00:33:41.791 --> 00:33:43.750
You're acting different today.

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:46.875
What is this?

00:33:48.041 --> 00:33:49.250
What do you mean?

00:33:50.333 --> 00:33:52.000
Are you messing with me?

00:33:53.416 --> 00:33:55.708
It's not like that.

00:33:59.666 --> 00:34:00.958
Do you like me?

00:34:04.958 --> 00:34:06.416
Or do you hate me?

00:34:07.666 --> 00:34:09.500
It's not that I hate you.

00:34:09.583 --> 00:34:10.791
So, you do like me?

00:34:13.083 --> 00:34:16.125
Why would I try to sleep
with someone I don't like twice?

00:34:16.208 --> 00:34:17.666
Does that mean you like me?

00:34:18.166 --> 00:34:19.958
Don't mess with my head.

00:34:22.541 --> 00:34:25.708
I've got my reasons too.

00:34:25.791 --> 00:34:26.625
Bye.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.333
I won't know…

00:34:34.375 --> 00:34:35.708
unless you tell me.

00:34:38.458 --> 00:34:39.791
What reasons?

00:34:58.083 --> 00:35:01.666
I'll just set this down
and leave right away.

00:35:02.166 --> 00:35:03.833
It'll be fine.

00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:18.083
You don't need to see.

00:35:19.833 --> 00:35:21.458
M-Mr. Fujiwara?

00:35:25.333 --> 00:35:27.083
Just keep your eyes on me.

00:35:27.875 --> 00:35:29.125
Like we practiced.

00:35:35.208 --> 00:35:36.041
Huh?

00:35:38.375 --> 00:35:39.208
What?

00:35:40.208 --> 00:35:41.250
Doctor?

00:35:41.833 --> 00:35:42.791
Doc…

00:35:42.875 --> 00:35:44.125
Darth Vader.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.250
Why are you here?

00:35:46.958 --> 00:35:49.625
What are you doing, Doctor?

00:35:51.041 --> 00:35:55.041
Well, uh… it's a long story.

00:35:56.333 --> 00:35:59.666
Um, do you two know each other?

00:36:00.333 --> 00:36:02.208
I'd ask the same about you two.

00:36:03.041 --> 00:36:06.708
Don't tell me Darth Vader is…

00:36:08.125 --> 00:36:09.500
Miracle Touch?

00:36:18.375 --> 00:36:19.291
Oh?

00:36:20.166 --> 00:36:21.416
What are you doing?

00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:23.083
Hey.

00:36:23.583 --> 00:36:26.166
That's right! She's Miracle Touch.

00:36:27.958 --> 00:36:29.208
Let me introduce you.

00:36:30.291 --> 00:36:34.375
She's the one I'm really into right now.

00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:54.083
Huh?

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.875
