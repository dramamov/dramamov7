00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:19.541
Sarang…

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.041
I must've misheard that, right?

00:00:25.833 --> 00:00:27.416
No, I said it.

00:00:29.333 --> 00:00:32.041
You said it yourself, Hana.

00:00:33.375 --> 00:00:38.083
It's the feeling of wanting
to make the one you love even happier.

00:00:38.583 --> 00:00:41.125
That feeling is called sarang.

00:00:41.208 --> 00:00:42.458
Oh…

00:00:43.125 --> 00:00:46.750
I meant to tell you
the word for love toward family,

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.500
but I guess I used the wrong term.

00:00:51.083 --> 00:00:53.166
We're not at that stage yet.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.083
Sarang.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.333
It has a nice ring to it.

00:00:57.416 --> 00:00:58.250
Sarang.

00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:02.583
No! A man shouldn't say that
to a woman so casually.

00:01:03.083 --> 00:01:05.000
Sarang is off-limits.

00:01:05.083 --> 00:01:06.583
-Sarang.
-I said no!

00:01:09.416 --> 00:01:10.250
Saranghae.

00:01:11.125 --> 00:01:14.041
Stop! Don't say that!

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.625
Saranghae is off-limits too!

00:01:18.458 --> 00:01:19.416
Saranghae!

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.458
Cut it out already!

00:01:23.708 --> 00:01:24.541
Hello?

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.875
-Good evening.
-Good evening. I'm Fujiwara.

00:01:39.375 --> 00:01:41.500
He's in the room at the end of the hall.

00:01:45.458 --> 00:01:47.208
What happened?

00:01:47.291 --> 00:01:51.833
He passed out at home
and was taken to the hospital.

00:01:51.916 --> 00:01:53.958
Nobody found him for a while.

00:01:54.041 --> 00:01:57.458
Lately, shareholders
have been reaching out to investors,

00:01:57.541 --> 00:02:00.250
trying to gather more shares.

00:02:00.333 --> 00:02:03.750
He seemed quite stressed about it.

00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:26.666
Due to Representative Director
Shuntaro Fujiwara's health issues,

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.000
Futago Confectionery will implement
an emergency management structure.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.958
To avoid a vacancy in management,

00:02:35.458 --> 00:02:39.250
we'll form a Management Advisory Committee

00:02:39.333 --> 00:02:41.500
with the acting officer
and key executives.

00:02:41.583 --> 00:02:42.958
I promise to restore

00:02:43.041 --> 00:02:46.583
normal management operations
as soon as possible.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.625
I object.

00:02:49.125 --> 00:02:50.416
What's the matter?

00:02:52.041 --> 00:02:55.041
I'm the son of the late Shotaro Fujiwara,

00:02:55.125 --> 00:02:58.500
younger brother of Chairman Fujiwara
and co-founder of this company,

00:02:58.583 --> 00:02:59.625
Takashi Fujiwara.

00:03:00.875 --> 00:03:03.083
As the co-owner's son,

00:03:03.166 --> 00:03:05.875
I can't sit back and watch
the chairman and his son

00:03:05.958 --> 00:03:08.291
run this family business negligently.

00:03:08.375 --> 00:03:12.041
To prevent further damage
to Futago Confectionery's value,

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.833
I will call for the dismissal
of Shuntaro and Sosuke Fujiwara,

00:03:18.458 --> 00:03:21.166
the representative director and director,

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.791
at the next shareholders' meeting.

00:03:25.375 --> 00:03:28.875
Preparations are underway
for an extraordinary general meeting.

00:03:31.166 --> 00:03:34.333
You unilaterally broke our contract
with the cacao supplier,

00:03:34.416 --> 00:03:37.791
yet took no steps to secure a new source.

00:03:38.291 --> 00:03:39.416
Furthermore,

00:03:40.166 --> 00:03:43.208
you've been uncooperative
about our future flagship product,

00:03:43.291 --> 00:03:45.416
the collaboration with Le Sauveur.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.083
Withholding the recipes
is also inexcusable.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.333
So you've been planning this all along?

00:03:54.833 --> 00:03:58.083
You've just given it too little thought.

00:03:59.083 --> 00:04:00.625
In the first place,

00:04:01.125 --> 00:04:04.208
you seemed indifferent
to Futago Confectionery's future.

00:04:06.583 --> 00:04:08.750
The chairman
often complained about you too.

00:04:10.541 --> 00:04:13.000
Perhaps he collapsed from illness

00:04:13.583 --> 00:04:16.541
due to the stress you caused him.

00:04:19.416 --> 00:04:20.916
Let's play fair.

00:04:23.375 --> 00:04:26.916
Though it must be tough
dealing with mental illness.

00:04:43.625 --> 00:04:44.666
Sosuke!

00:04:47.791 --> 00:04:48.625
Takashi.

00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:53.208
Just ignore this nonsense.

00:04:55.041 --> 00:04:59.375
Still, a company executive dating
an employee can put the company at risk.

00:05:00.666 --> 00:05:02.083
I asked you

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.500
to follow him as a shadow, didn't I?

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.083
Did you forget?

00:05:08.916 --> 00:05:09.958
A shadow

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.750
goes wherever it's led.

00:05:13.916 --> 00:05:15.541
That's all it needs to do.

00:05:16.708 --> 00:05:18.625
A shadow doesn't need opinions.

00:05:18.708 --> 00:05:19.583
Yes, sir.

00:05:22.166 --> 00:05:25.125
I hear someone's been buying up
Futago Confectionery shares.

00:05:27.291 --> 00:05:28.583
A business leader

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.833
needs the quality of a dreamer.

00:05:32.416 --> 00:05:33.625
A leader also needs

00:05:33.708 --> 00:05:36.791
the composure to let go
of dreams without hesitation.

00:05:37.375 --> 00:05:40.791
That's not something
you gain through hard work.

00:05:42.083 --> 00:05:44.625
It's rooted deep inside you.

00:05:45.458 --> 00:05:46.958
Unfortunately, Takashi,

00:05:48.125 --> 00:05:49.708
you lack that quality.

00:05:50.833 --> 00:05:54.333
That's the major difference
between you and Sosuke.

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:58.916
Your father

00:06:00.333 --> 00:06:05.208
devoted his life to Futago Confectionery.

00:06:06.666 --> 00:06:08.416
Don't forget that.

00:06:23.416 --> 00:06:26.875
Futago Confectionery,
still facing management turmoil,

00:06:26.958 --> 00:06:30.541
plans to hold an extraordinary
general meeting on the 30th.

00:06:31.041 --> 00:06:35.625
The meeting will address
a proposal to dismiss

00:06:35.708 --> 00:06:40.291
Representative Director Shuntaro Fujiwara
and Director Sosuke Fujiwara

00:06:40.375 --> 00:06:42.833
and put it to a shareholder vote.

00:06:42.916 --> 00:06:47.750
This year, Futago Confectionery
acquired Le Sauveur

00:06:47.833 --> 00:06:50.708
to gain new chocolate-making expertise.

00:06:51.208 --> 00:06:53.916
However, losses incurred
from the acquisition

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
has spurred calls for accountability…

00:07:28.708 --> 00:07:32.583
-Ta-da!
-Ta-da!

00:07:34.708 --> 00:07:37.291
It's so nice to see you again,

00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:40.083
Ms. Anonymous Chocolatier.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:43.458
Hello, everyone.

00:07:45.375 --> 00:07:47.583
Thank you so much.

00:07:48.916 --> 00:07:50.458
Glad to have you back.

00:07:51.041 --> 00:07:52.791
-Welcome back.
-Welcome back!

00:07:58.541 --> 00:08:00.083
Oh, I see.

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:05.416
Thank you.

00:08:11.125 --> 00:08:14.666
Is the competition prep going well?

00:08:15.416 --> 00:08:16.500
Yes.

00:08:16.583 --> 00:08:19.583
Everyone's been very considerate.

00:08:22.583 --> 00:08:23.833
Are you okay?

00:08:27.125 --> 00:08:28.416
The thing is…

00:08:31.375 --> 00:08:33.500
I might not make it to the competition.

00:08:34.208 --> 00:08:36.791
It's on the same day and time

00:08:38.375 --> 00:08:41.958
as Futago Confectionery's
shareholders' meeting.

00:08:42.791 --> 00:08:44.041
That's totally fine.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.125
After all, protecting
the company is more important.

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:56.083
Honestly, keeping control
of management rights will be tough.

00:08:57.583 --> 00:09:02.958
Getting over 50% of the votes
is practically impossible.

00:09:04.166 --> 00:09:08.041
That is, without funding
to help buy more shares.

00:09:10.250 --> 00:09:11.833
Maybe you can't do it alone,

00:09:12.416 --> 00:09:15.958
but together with everyone,
I think you can.

00:09:22.833 --> 00:09:25.625
TAKASHI 29.62%, SOSUKE 19.88%

00:09:25.708 --> 00:09:26.875
Is it really possible?

00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:31.291
You know I'm the type
to follow my heart over logic.

00:09:31.875 --> 00:09:34.833
I'll do whatever I can.

00:09:35.333 --> 00:09:37.041
Duty and bonds come first!

00:09:37.875 --> 00:09:40.000
I really appreciate it.

00:09:40.083 --> 00:09:43.000
Yes, I'll call again.

00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:44.125
Goodbye.

00:09:57.375 --> 00:10:00.333
If you're facing a crisis,

00:10:00.416 --> 00:10:04.541
Gabriel Blossom will buy
Futago Confectionery shares.

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:06.666
Thank you.

00:10:07.625 --> 00:10:08.791
Yes.

00:10:14.416 --> 00:10:19.708
Our winery will invest
as much as possible to support you.

00:10:26.666 --> 00:10:28.833
-Hello?
-It's been a while, Mr. Fujiwara.

00:10:29.333 --> 00:10:33.208
This is Reiko Sugiyama,
CEO of Eida Capital.

00:10:34.833 --> 00:10:39.375
Our company would like
to purchase 3% of your shares.

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:53.583
-So this is it.
-This one?

00:10:53.666 --> 00:10:54.625
This song, huh?

00:10:54.708 --> 00:10:56.833
Wait, I like this song too.

00:10:57.333 --> 00:10:59.666
-You listen to this kind of music?
-It's nice.

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:00.583
Yes.

00:11:01.291 --> 00:11:02.541
Wow.

00:11:27.291 --> 00:11:29.375
Let's exclude this one.

00:11:29.458 --> 00:11:30.666
-Huh?
-Okay.

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:32.708
-That one's no good?
-Yeah.

00:11:33.541 --> 00:11:35.666
This one too. Yeah.

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:38.041
Wow, you're strict.

00:11:41.416 --> 00:11:43.125
Yeah, I think it's good.

00:11:43.916 --> 00:11:45.750
3:13 p.m.

00:11:54.458 --> 00:11:55.458
Beautiful.

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:57.583
All right!

00:11:57.666 --> 00:11:59.750
My apologies for the sudden call.

00:12:01.083 --> 00:12:02.583
Oh, yes, that's right.

00:12:03.625 --> 00:12:06.750
I'm calling about
the shareholders' meeting.

00:12:11.416 --> 00:12:12.416
Yes.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:13.833
Right.

00:12:15.166 --> 00:12:16.416
Oh, I see.

00:12:22.791 --> 00:12:24.875
Yes. Uh-huh.

00:12:24.958 --> 00:12:28.166
We'd appreciate your support
leading up to the meeting.

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:30.750
Hello? Yes.

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:32.958
Have you received the notice

00:12:33.041 --> 00:12:36.416
about the shareholders' meeting
from Futago Confectionery?

00:12:41.291 --> 00:12:43.458
I see.

00:12:44.375 --> 00:12:49.958
Still, I hope you'll make
a careful decision at the meeting.

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:52.833
Thank you.

00:12:58.375 --> 00:12:59.208
So…

00:13:01.291 --> 00:13:05.375
These shareholders
already support Takashi,

00:13:05.458 --> 00:13:07.500
so it's a bit tough right now.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.791
What's this triangle?

00:13:10.291 --> 00:13:11.750
1.25%?

00:13:11.833 --> 00:13:13.083
FUMIKO KUROIWA

00:13:13.166 --> 00:13:15.375
If we could get her on board,

00:13:15.916 --> 00:13:18.291
we could make it a close race.

00:13:18.958 --> 00:13:21.541
You don't have her contact info, do you?

00:13:22.583 --> 00:13:24.166
Fumiko Kuroiwa?

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:29.625
Let's try contacting Ms. Fumiko Kuroiwa,
an individual shareholder.

00:13:30.125 --> 00:13:32.708
That 1.25% is crucial.

00:13:32.791 --> 00:13:36.333
Of course we tried,
but we got no response.

00:13:36.958 --> 00:13:39.458
She doesn't seem interested in stocks.

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:43.333
Her only shares are
from the third-party allotment

00:13:43.416 --> 00:13:46.250
and what she inherited
from her late husband.

00:13:46.333 --> 00:13:49.333
So she probably won't vote.

00:14:40.208 --> 00:14:42.625
-Hey.
-Hi there!

00:14:42.708 --> 00:14:44.208
Thank you for coming.

00:14:46.958 --> 00:14:48.333
Maybe you were in a rush,

00:14:49.083 --> 00:14:51.708
but you forgot something important.

00:14:52.208 --> 00:14:53.041
Huh?

00:15:02.416 --> 00:15:03.500
Everyone…

00:15:04.416 --> 00:15:06.833
It was Chief's idea.

00:15:09.125 --> 00:15:11.833
If Chef Kenji had seen you wear this,

00:15:11.916 --> 00:15:14.500
he would've been happier than anyone.

00:15:18.083 --> 00:15:19.583
Thank you so much.

00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:23.416
Hana, hwaiting!

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:24.750
Hwaiting!

00:15:24.833 --> 00:15:26.083
You got this!

00:16:01.458 --> 00:16:03.875
Ms. Lee Hana, please get ready.

00:16:03.958 --> 00:16:04.833
Okay.

00:16:27.791 --> 00:16:32.041
Representing Japan,
from Le Sauveur, Lee Hana!

00:17:11.583 --> 00:17:13.458
-You can do it!
-You got this!

00:17:43.166 --> 00:17:45.875
The competition has started!

00:17:45.958 --> 00:17:47.791
Good luck, everyone!

00:18:05.416 --> 00:18:07.916
I'm Sosuke Fujiwara,

00:18:08.416 --> 00:18:12.125
acting representative director
of Futago Confectionery.

00:18:17.333 --> 00:18:19.625
Before we start with today's agenda…

00:18:22.458 --> 00:18:25.500
to provide you
with a clear picture of our business,

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.125
I'd planned to share our vision
and long-term challenges.

00:18:33.791 --> 00:18:36.333
That was the plan,

00:18:37.583 --> 00:18:38.416
but…

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:47.166
Instead of a formal report…

00:18:49.791 --> 00:18:51.375
today…

00:18:55.875 --> 00:19:00.291
I want to talk about what it means
to offer the finest chocolate.

00:19:00.791 --> 00:19:02.500
Please allow me

00:19:03.458 --> 00:19:07.666
to share what I've learned so far.

00:19:09.708 --> 00:19:11.291
As you know,

00:19:12.375 --> 00:19:16.125
I've been the president
of Le Sauveur since its acquisition.

00:19:16.208 --> 00:19:19.416
Through the history
and tradition Le Sauveur has built,

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:25.083
the changes, and its bonds
with many different people…

00:19:26.833 --> 00:19:29.791
It's not the ingredients that matter,

00:19:29.875 --> 00:19:34.291
but the heart of the maker behind them.

00:19:34.791 --> 00:19:35.625
The heart?

00:19:36.125 --> 00:19:40.166
It's not just about skills or recipes.

00:19:40.833 --> 00:19:45.750
The chocolatiers' happiness matters too.

00:19:46.666 --> 00:19:49.125
I've finally come to understand that.

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:54.000
Whenever my heart ached,

00:19:55.166 --> 00:19:57.666
the chocolates from this shop
brought me comfort.

00:19:58.416 --> 00:20:03.291
And that's not just true for chocolatiers.

00:20:03.833 --> 00:20:06.416
My respect goes to everyone involved

00:20:06.916 --> 00:20:10.708
in the process of making chocolate.

00:20:20.375 --> 00:20:22.666
"Le Chocolat du Bonheur."

00:20:27.250 --> 00:20:29.125
The Chocolate of Happiness.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.375
The Chocolate of Happiness.

00:20:35.166 --> 00:20:37.666
I believe the role of chocolate

00:20:38.958 --> 00:20:42.375
is to make our world and our daily lives

00:20:43.791 --> 00:20:48.750
just a little happier.

00:20:51.208 --> 00:20:52.250
That's why

00:20:53.625 --> 00:20:56.041
something made from a stolen recipe…

00:20:58.916 --> 00:21:01.833
can't bring happiness to anyone.

00:21:12.708 --> 00:21:13.583
Right.

00:21:16.125 --> 00:21:19.458
If I truly wanted chocolate

00:21:20.666 --> 00:21:23.416
to bring joy
to as many people as possible,

00:21:26.125 --> 00:21:32.125
I should've worked with Le Sauveur
to create new chocolate.

00:21:33.333 --> 00:21:34.625
It's truly excellent.

00:21:37.125 --> 00:21:39.250
Look over here, Hana!

00:21:40.208 --> 00:21:41.583
Ready, go.

00:21:43.583 --> 00:21:45.416
Boss is cheering for you too!

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:46.666
He's watching!

00:21:49.083 --> 00:21:50.916
Through Le Sauveur,

00:21:52.708 --> 00:21:57.583
I've met so many people
who found joy with a single bite.

00:22:03.416 --> 00:22:04.708
Isn't that

00:22:06.125 --> 00:22:07.708
a miracle?

00:22:12.208 --> 00:22:13.583
Won't you dream…

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:17.000
of such a miracle…

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.541
with me…

00:22:23.833 --> 00:22:25.833
at Futago Confectionery?

00:22:52.041 --> 00:22:54.000
On another note,

00:22:55.708 --> 00:22:58.791
a chocolatier at Le Sauveur,
where I'm the president,

00:22:59.708 --> 00:23:03.583
is about to showcase
the finest chocolate to the world

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:07.375
at the World Chocolatier Masters.

00:23:09.833 --> 00:23:13.625
I realized even someone like me

00:23:14.125 --> 00:23:16.666
can contribute in some small way.

00:23:19.958 --> 00:23:21.625
So if you'll excuse me,

00:23:22.208 --> 00:23:24.041
I'll take my leave now.

00:23:24.125 --> 00:23:26.125
Thank you for your time.

00:23:29.958 --> 00:23:31.708
Our apologies for the disruption.

00:23:32.291 --> 00:23:36.208
We will now take questions
from our shareholders.

00:23:36.791 --> 00:23:39.000
Any shareholder with a question,

00:23:39.083 --> 00:23:40.791
please raise your hand.

00:23:42.958 --> 00:23:45.583
Yes, the person in the middle row

00:23:45.666 --> 00:23:48.000
in the navy cardigan.

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:51.500
I'm number 28,

00:23:52.333 --> 00:23:54.333
Fumiko Kuroiwa.

00:23:54.958 --> 00:23:59.000
My husband is Kenji Kuroiwa, a chocolatier

00:23:59.083 --> 00:24:02.083
and former head of Le Sauveur.

00:24:05.875 --> 00:24:08.625
After losing my husband,

00:24:08.708 --> 00:24:11.625
I struggled with severe mental illness.

00:24:13.208 --> 00:24:18.333
When I finally built up the courage
to step outside again,

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:23.166
the first person to comfort me

00:24:23.666 --> 00:24:27.458
was Mr. Sosuke Fujiwara,
who gave me chocolate.

00:24:28.666 --> 00:24:33.750
He can bring happiness and comfort
with just a single chocolate.

00:24:34.708 --> 00:24:36.708
I wish to endorse the miracle

00:24:38.041 --> 00:24:40.416
he creates.

00:24:42.166 --> 00:24:49.166
My full support goes
to the current president, Sosuke Fujiwara.

00:25:09.833 --> 00:25:14.416
Thanks to everyone's support,
I can stand here today.

00:25:14.916 --> 00:25:17.750
I'm truly grateful
from the bottom of my heart.

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:20.625
Thank you, Jil.

00:25:23.541 --> 00:25:26.250
Next, we have Ms. Lee Hana
from Le Sauveur.

00:25:26.333 --> 00:25:27.416
Please come forward.

00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:45.541
Could you tell us
about the chocolate you made?

00:25:57.875 --> 00:25:59.041
The…

00:26:04.166 --> 00:26:08.041
Th-The chocolate I made is…

00:26:16.083 --> 00:26:16.916
Hana!

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.583
It's okay, Hana!

00:26:19.083 --> 00:26:20.375
You're doing great!

00:27:03.833 --> 00:27:04.833
No way.

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:18.583
I'm…

00:27:20.666 --> 00:27:24.166
someone who was saved by chocolate.

00:27:25.875 --> 00:27:29.041
Only when I was making chocolate

00:27:29.625 --> 00:27:31.666
did I feel truly happy.

00:27:33.083 --> 00:27:35.375
It gave me the strength to live.

00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:41.166
I made this chocolate
hoping it could do the same

00:27:42.375 --> 00:27:44.458
for someone struggling now.

00:27:46.166 --> 00:27:48.125
No matter the outcome,

00:27:48.916 --> 00:27:53.750
I hope this chocolate
brings happiness to all of you.

00:27:55.583 --> 00:27:56.875
Thank you.

00:28:21.875 --> 00:28:24.000
JAPAN'S LE SAUVEUR TAKES THE CROWN!

00:28:32.708 --> 00:28:36.791
MOTION TO DISMISS SHUNTARO
AND SOSUKE FUJIWARA REJECTED

00:28:37.375 --> 00:28:39.708
Yes, yes, yes.

00:28:45.083 --> 00:28:46.416
You were so cool!

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:48.291
I was seriously moved!

00:28:48.375 --> 00:28:51.000
That was awesome!

00:28:51.083 --> 00:28:54.750
-Thanks for representing Le Sauveur!
-It was the boss, right?

00:28:54.833 --> 00:28:56.916
You calmed down when you saw him.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.750
I was a teeny bit nervous.

00:28:58.833 --> 00:28:59.875
Right?

00:28:59.958 --> 00:29:02.291
-Congrats!
-Man, that was great!

00:29:02.375 --> 00:29:03.583
Are you sure?

00:29:06.125 --> 00:29:07.416
Look at this!

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:10.000
We won it!

00:29:51.333 --> 00:29:52.833
One last thing.

00:29:53.583 --> 00:29:56.208
Can I ask you one question?

00:29:56.291 --> 00:29:57.708
As a friend.

00:29:58.708 --> 00:29:59.875
What is it?

00:30:00.375 --> 00:30:01.916
How come

00:30:02.958 --> 00:30:06.791
I can look Mr. Fujiwara in the eyes?

00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:13.750
How do you feel when you look at Sosuke?

00:30:15.708 --> 00:30:17.666
When I look at him…

00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:23.500
Ever since I first saw him,

00:30:23.583 --> 00:30:26.833
I don't know why,
but he's been on my mind.

00:30:39.125 --> 00:30:41.458
He's taking a while.

00:30:51.666 --> 00:30:53.375
You had a petal on you.

00:31:03.916 --> 00:31:05.458
Just by meeting his eyes…

00:31:07.541 --> 00:31:09.791
I know what he's trying to say.

00:31:10.875 --> 00:31:12.458
If his eyes are sad,

00:31:12.541 --> 00:31:16.250
for some reason, I feel sad too.

00:31:17.541 --> 00:31:20.708
I can sense just how happy he is.

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:31.625
Wherever he is, my eyes follow him.

00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:34.958
If he's not there,
I end up looking for him.

00:31:37.541 --> 00:31:38.750
Hana.

00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:41.375
Sounds like you're totally in love.

00:31:42.583 --> 00:31:44.625
Like he's your soulmate.

00:31:45.541 --> 00:31:46.375
Huh?

00:32:00.458 --> 00:32:03.083
I get it now.

00:32:06.958 --> 00:32:08.166
This is

00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:11.250
my real confession.

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:18.708
I love you.

00:32:24.958 --> 00:32:25.833
That's not it.

00:32:29.375 --> 00:32:30.458
This is…

00:32:33.791 --> 00:32:34.666
sarang.

00:33:36.208 --> 00:33:37.750
I thought if I took everything,

00:33:38.958 --> 00:33:41.041
I'd be happy.

00:33:44.625 --> 00:33:46.541
But even if I had reached my goal,

00:33:48.208 --> 00:33:50.458
I never imagined…

00:33:52.791 --> 00:33:54.708
I'd feel so awful.

00:33:58.833 --> 00:34:01.958
Ever since Dad died…

00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:05.958
Uncle's been like a father to me.

00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:10.291
And you were my family.

00:34:13.083 --> 00:34:16.458
I never wanted to trample
over something so precious

00:34:17.666 --> 00:34:20.500
just to take over Futago Confectionery.

00:34:22.125 --> 00:34:23.250
I just…

00:34:27.291 --> 00:34:28.833
wanted to be recognized.

00:34:32.166 --> 00:34:33.333
By you…

00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:36.583
and by Uncle.

00:34:41.166 --> 00:34:42.333
You always…

00:34:45.791 --> 00:34:48.666
put me first.

00:34:50.583 --> 00:34:53.666
But I never showed you my gratitude.

00:34:57.708 --> 00:35:00.791
I guess it's because
I was completely worthless.

00:35:02.375 --> 00:35:04.500
I should've been more grateful.

00:35:07.208 --> 00:35:09.333
I took you for granted
since you're family.

00:35:11.916 --> 00:35:12.958
I'm sorry.

00:35:16.208 --> 00:35:17.791
From now on, how about we team up?

00:35:18.291 --> 00:35:21.041
We can run the company as two leaders.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:28.375
We can't afford
to lose someone as capable as you.

00:35:30.541 --> 00:35:31.583
But…

00:35:34.791 --> 00:35:37.083
I'll just end up as your shadow again.

00:35:39.333 --> 00:35:40.291
For good.

00:35:42.541 --> 00:35:47.041
No one is only light or only shadow.

00:35:48.041 --> 00:35:50.666
Shadow can't exist without light,

00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:53.000
and light can't exist without shadow.

00:35:53.791 --> 00:35:56.333
That's what makes a team.

00:36:01.541 --> 00:36:06.000
Dad always said that,
while thanking Uncle.

00:36:11.625 --> 00:36:12.458
Oh?

00:36:13.291 --> 00:36:14.125
Just now,

00:36:15.333 --> 00:36:16.541
you were moved, huh?

00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:20.916
I can tell.

00:36:25.250 --> 00:36:27.000
You're so annoying.

00:36:28.166 --> 00:36:30.208
And seriously, "two leaders"?

00:36:34.833 --> 00:36:35.875
Sosuke.

00:36:37.291 --> 00:36:42.000
Uncle's… going to be okay, right?

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:54.833
Chairman.

00:36:59.125 --> 00:37:00.333
I'm fine.

00:37:00.416 --> 00:37:02.250
It's nothing serious.

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:11.041
I was worried.

00:37:13.666 --> 00:37:15.291
Nothing to worry about.

00:37:17.875 --> 00:37:19.000
All this time…

00:37:21.375 --> 00:37:23.375
you've been carrying the burden alone…

00:37:26.708 --> 00:37:29.833
to protect me and the company.

00:37:37.208 --> 00:37:39.208
I'm sorry I wasn't able…

00:37:41.208 --> 00:37:42.166
to support you.

00:37:49.291 --> 00:37:50.833
Even at a time like this…

00:37:53.416 --> 00:37:56.583
I still can't touch you.

00:38:20.916 --> 00:38:22.916
-Sosuke.
-Don't touch me!

00:39:35.708 --> 00:39:37.041
Le Sauveur.

00:39:39.041 --> 00:39:42.625
What does it mean?

00:39:45.166 --> 00:39:46.625
"Savior."

00:39:48.416 --> 00:39:50.125
"Savior"?

00:39:51.916 --> 00:39:57.958
If I can offer even a little salvation
to someone going through a hard life

00:39:58.708 --> 00:40:01.416
in the form of sweetness…

00:40:02.416 --> 00:40:06.666
Well, I couldn't wish for anything more.

00:40:10.291 --> 00:40:11.375
Salvation…

00:40:36.083 --> 00:40:40.458
Starting today,
I'll be working in the kitchen.

00:40:40.541 --> 00:40:42.708
I'm Lee Hana, a chocolatier.

00:40:42.791 --> 00:40:45.125
I look forward to working with you all!

00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:27.416
Dear Dr. Irene,

00:41:27.916 --> 00:41:29.291
How have you been?

00:41:29.375 --> 00:41:34.458
It's already been a year
since you left on your long journey.

00:41:35.166 --> 00:41:39.500
Futago Confectionery's mission
isn't just to make excellent products.

00:41:39.583 --> 00:41:43.500
Sosuke has been working tirelessly
to bring change and innovation

00:41:43.583 --> 00:41:46.666
to Futago Confectionery as CEO.

00:41:47.875 --> 00:41:50.416
Motomi, our newly appointed president,

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:52.583
seems to have a lot on her plate.

00:41:52.666 --> 00:41:57.458
She's not only suited to making chocolate,
but also to running the shop.

00:41:57.541 --> 00:42:01.500
All right, let's keep doing our best

00:42:01.583 --> 00:42:04.166
to bring happiness through our chocolate.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000
With all our hearts, today and always…

00:42:07.083 --> 00:42:09.041
-With all our hearts.
-With all our hearts.

00:42:09.125 --> 00:42:10.541
Let's give it our all.

00:42:10.625 --> 00:42:12.500
-We'll give it our all.
-We'll give it our all.

00:42:13.625 --> 00:42:16.125
As for me, I've been in the kitchen,

00:42:16.208 --> 00:42:19.458
working with everyone
to protect tradition,

00:42:19.541 --> 00:42:22.541
while embracing change at times.

00:42:22.625 --> 00:42:26.500
I'm crafting everyday happiness
in the form of chocolate.

00:42:28.208 --> 00:42:30.500
-Here's the yuzu.
-Thanks.

00:42:30.583 --> 00:42:32.833
Chef Motomi, this is peach blossom.

00:42:32.916 --> 00:42:35.000
Got it. It's beautiful.

00:42:35.583 --> 00:42:40.625
I do it believing that the happiness
of a chocolatier can reach others.

00:42:41.666 --> 00:42:44.291
-Wow.
-Okay, looks good.

00:42:44.375 --> 00:42:45.708
Yeah.

00:42:45.791 --> 00:42:47.416
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:42:52.875 --> 00:42:54.083
Here we go.

00:42:58.958 --> 00:43:01.333
It's so beautiful.

00:43:02.166 --> 00:43:03.291
Wow.

00:43:03.375 --> 00:43:04.583
Beautiful.

00:43:05.833 --> 00:43:10.333
I hope, wherever you are,
you're living happily.

00:43:11.250 --> 00:43:14.125
From your friend, Lee Hana.

00:44:03.041 --> 00:44:05.750
You look stunning, Hana.

00:44:06.458 --> 00:44:07.416
Thanks.

00:44:10.416 --> 00:44:11.250
Are you okay?

00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:16.708
Sorry the chairman insisted
even though we didn't want a ceremony.

00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:19.541
It's okay.

00:44:20.916 --> 00:44:24.333
As long as we're together,
I think I can handle it.

00:44:25.208 --> 00:44:26.583
I'll try to manage too.

00:44:28.833 --> 00:44:30.500
With love, we'll be fine.

00:44:30.583 --> 00:44:32.458
It'll go well, right?

00:44:33.291 --> 00:44:34.125
Yeah.

00:44:35.083 --> 00:44:36.083
If we're together.

00:44:36.583 --> 00:44:39.250
We will now begin the wedding,

00:44:39.333 --> 00:44:42.000
held in the presence of all our guests.

00:44:42.083 --> 00:44:44.250
The couple will exchange vows

00:44:44.333 --> 00:44:46.958
and receive your acknowledgement

00:44:47.041 --> 00:44:49.083
in this civil ceremony.

00:44:49.666 --> 00:44:52.708
We hope you'll join us in witnessing

00:44:52.791 --> 00:44:55.666
this new chapter in their lives.

00:44:55.750 --> 00:44:59.750
Please wait a little longer
until the ceremony begins.

00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:03.583
Sorry, excuse me!

00:45:12.916 --> 00:45:14.625
Another coincidence?

00:45:16.833 --> 00:45:18.708
Of course not.

00:45:20.875 --> 00:45:25.166
I got up early and put more effort
into getting ready than the bride.

00:45:35.458 --> 00:45:36.458
Yeah, I get it.

00:45:36.541 --> 00:45:39.000
You're thinking, "Here she goes again."

00:45:42.291 --> 00:45:44.166
Remember what you told me?

00:45:44.958 --> 00:45:49.083
You said our future is ours to choose.

00:45:55.250 --> 00:45:57.375
So this is the choice I made.

00:46:02.083 --> 00:46:04.000
I want to start from here.

00:46:05.125 --> 00:46:06.875
I'm Airi Namikawa.

00:46:17.541 --> 00:46:19.916
Don't I get a say in this?

00:46:21.916 --> 00:46:24.541
Ladies and gentlemen,
please turn toward the rear doors.

00:46:24.625 --> 00:46:26.375
Here comes the groom, Sosuke!

00:46:26.458 --> 00:46:29.041
Come on, hurry! This is embarrassing!

00:46:29.125 --> 00:46:30.041
It's about to start.

00:46:50.333 --> 00:46:51.708
Congrats!

00:46:51.791 --> 00:46:52.833
Boss!

00:47:03.625 --> 00:47:07.875
And now, the entrance
of the beautiful bride.

00:47:07.958 --> 00:47:10.250
Please welcome her
with a warm round of applause.

00:47:59.583 --> 00:48:02.875
Oh, looks like our impatient groom
is going to escort his bride.

00:48:14.083 --> 00:48:15.041
Are you okay?

00:48:17.708 --> 00:48:18.583
I can't.

00:48:52.208 --> 00:48:53.625
Congrats!

00:49:07.791 --> 00:49:09.375
Are we nuts or what?

00:49:09.875 --> 00:49:13.291
Totally nuts. We're not normal anyway.

00:49:13.375 --> 00:49:15.916
We're way too nuts!

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.958
We're nuts, and it's amazing!

00:49:19.458 --> 00:49:21.291
Saranghae!

00:49:21.375 --> 00:49:24.041
Naega deo saranghae!

00:50:15.125 --> 00:50:16.625
Hello, everyone.

00:50:17.541 --> 00:50:18.916
Feeling nervous?

00:50:20.458 --> 00:50:24.458
Thank you for joining me
in this term's Anonymous Circle.

00:50:24.958 --> 00:50:30.208
Through these sessions,
many people have faced their symptoms.

00:50:30.708 --> 00:50:33.958
I believe it will benefit you too.

00:50:34.625 --> 00:50:36.458
And starting this term,

00:50:36.541 --> 00:50:40.541
we have a wonderful new counselor
who will be joining us.

00:50:46.125 --> 00:50:48.833
Hello, I'm Ando.

00:50:49.416 --> 00:50:50.833
Nice to meet you all.

00:50:53.083 --> 00:50:55.541
Let's work through this together.

00:50:57.250 --> 00:50:58.958
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:55:50.291 --> 00:55:53.166
