00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.410
Good morning, Ms. Wang.

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:00.250
Good morning.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.380
Good morning, Ms. Wang.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:02.660
Good morning.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.860
Want one?

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.100
Thanks.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.940
This is really good.

00:02:34.155 --> 00:02:35.711
What is the meaning of this?

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.290
You didn't do any of it?

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.940
Did you leave after I left yesterday?

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.380
I'm asking you a question.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:49.780
Speak.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.010
You're just ripping the paper!

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.400
Let's see you rip it now!

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.450
Ms. Wang,

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.410
what happened?

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:01.260
Speak nicely.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.100
Shut up!

00:03:04.402 --> 00:03:05.332
You won't say it, right?

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.690
All right, come.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:08.530
Come with me.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.940
Come with me!

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.010
Ms. Wang.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:13.890
Come with me!

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.130
Did you try to set me up?

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.340
I didn't.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.820
You didn't, but you didn't do your work.

00:03:27.844 --> 00:03:28.940
If you didn't want to do it,

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.177
you shouldn't have agreed!

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.820
You agreed to do it for me
but you didn't!

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.340
Who works like you?

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.288
How can you still call yourself
a human being?

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:36.060
Do you know

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.290
that these forms
are used to apply for loans?

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.450
They must
be submitted to the bank today.

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.130
When Ms. Tao asks about it

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.660
and the company
can't get the loan approved today,

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:45.980
can you take responsibility?

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.540
You've caused all of us trouble.

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:51.980
I'm in a mess because of you too.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.660
Tell me. What will you do today?

00:03:54.493 --> 00:03:56.995
Anyway, I won't take the blame for this.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.780
Why are you keeping quiet?

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.100
Why are you keeping quiet?

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.060
Do you think you are helping me?

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.511
Do you think you can solve the problem
by staying silent?

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.170
Did I force you to do that?

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.060
Did I force you to agree?

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.050
Did I force you to do the task for me?

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:21.900
Ye Sibei,

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.220
do you really think

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.370
you don't need to work anymore

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.266
because you went drinking
with Mr. Fan once?

00:04:27.484 --> 00:04:30.484
I was wondering why
you weren't in your work clothes today.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.580
I was wondering
why you had been acting tough today.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:35.540
I heard

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.170
you had fun

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.170
drinking with Mr. Zheng a few days ago.

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.980
You were sharing drinks together.

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.290
Do you think you've found
someone to support you?

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:47.460
I'm warning you.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.780
As long as you are an employee here,
you must work for Fuqiang.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.340
Get out and apologize

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.540
to Ms. Tao immediately.

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.100
Otherwise, leave the company!

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.580
I dare you
to find Mr. Zheng to support you.

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.340
You're even crying crocodile tears?

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:04.810
What? Do you feel aggrieved?

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:05.930
Was I wrong to scold you?

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.290
Does your husband know about this?

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:11.490
He doesn't?

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:13.980
Why don't I help you tell him instead?

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:21.580
Why should I apologize?

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:23.290
Because I'm an easy target?

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.140
Do you think I'm weak?

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.100
Are you trying to rebel?

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.410
Ye Sibei, how dare you hit me!

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.410
How dare you!

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:39.660
You hit me?

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.100
I'll beat you to death!

00:05:51.777 --> 00:05:53.810
Wang Lin, what are you doing?
Have you gone mad?

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:56.050
You're so shameless! Get away!

00:05:58.222 --> 00:06:00.050
You're exactly
the type of shameless person!

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:01.290
I dare you to hit her again!

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:02.490
I dare you!

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.930
What are you doing?

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.370
What are you staring at?

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.580
- Lin! Lin, speak nicely.
- Why are you pulling me away?

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:09.610
Try hitting me again!

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.700
Stop!

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:12.660
What are you doing?

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.780
- I dare you to hit me again!
- Don't point at me! Try touching me again!

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:15.610
Let's speak nicely!

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:16.580
Call the police!

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:17.900
- That's enough.
- Those outside!

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:20.380
That's enough.

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:21.740
Speak nicely.

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:31.250
Hello.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:32.700
Hello, Nan.

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:33.540
Can you

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.088
come to the Guantian Police Station now?

00:06:35.733 --> 00:06:36.900
Sibei fought with someone.

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.422
They are trying to settle things now.

00:06:38.422 --> 00:06:41.155
The other person's husband is also here.
I'm afraid that we are at a disadvantage.

00:06:41.177 --> 00:06:41.810
Do you...

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:42.888
I'll head over immediately.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.540
(Mediator)
Officer, she hit me first.

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.290
(Involved Party)
Shouldn't she compensate me?

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:51.220
Shouldn't she apologize to me?

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.850
Are you the only loud person here?

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:54.370
You're so loud like a roe deer.

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:56.490
- What did you say?
- You want Sibei to apologize?

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:58.140
Everyone knows Sibei's character.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:06:59.050
How could she hit you?

00:06:59.177 --> 00:07:00.460
This is none of your business.

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:02.140
Can't she speak?

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:03.980
- Is she mute?
- Who are you?

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:05.460
Apologize to you?

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.155
Both of you are the ones
who should apologize.

00:07:07.177 --> 00:07:08.610
If you don't give us
an explanation today...

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:09.610
Stop arguing!

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:10.490
Quiet!

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:12.060
(Guantian Police Station)

00:07:12.244 --> 00:07:13.580
Ye Sibei's family member is here.

00:07:16.533 --> 00:07:18.930
Sibei, I was afraid
that we would be at a disadvantage

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:20.466
since Wang Lin called her husband here,

00:07:20.466 --> 00:07:21.644
so I called Nan as well.

00:07:21.666 --> 00:07:23.250
Sorry. A client's waiting for me.

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:24.140
I must go.

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:32.490
Nan, I'll leave her to you.

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:36.250
What happened?

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:37.850
What do you mean?

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:38.980
You called for backup?

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:40.850
Is this a gang fight?

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:42.610
Come on. Hit me right here.

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:43.460
Come on. Hit me!

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:44.780
Wang Lin, calm down.

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:49.060
Did she hit you?

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:50.330
Yes.

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:52.220
No. She didn't hit me.

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:53.450
She hit my wife.

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:55.410
Look at my face.
It's swollen because she hit me.

00:07:55.711 --> 00:07:57.133
Since the family members are here,

00:07:57.177 --> 00:07:58.333
sit down and settle this.

00:07:58.660 --> 00:07:59.500
Sit down.

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:06.050
What do both of you want now?

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:08.410
Do you want to settle this or not?

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:11.850
We can settle this.

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:14.580
But look at her attitude!

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:16.980
We are fine
with not getting any compensation

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:18.930
but she must at least apologize to me.

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:19.770
How much?

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:25.220
(Involved Party)

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:26.060
1,000 yuan.

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:29.010
Sorry.

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:36.220
Sorry. Can you forgive me?

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:39.340
Don't let him pay.

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:44.340
Do you agree? If you agree,

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:45.820
sign the mediation agreement.

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:48.210
Fine. Forget it.

00:08:48.333 --> 00:08:50.133
Since both sides
have agreed to settle this,

00:08:50.430 --> 00:08:51.280
sign the form.

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:52.911
I'll forget about it this time.

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:56.320
Here.

00:08:56.460 --> 00:08:57.300
Sign here.

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:06.260
(Involved Party Signature)

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:14.490
Why did you fight?

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:19.650
Excuse me, may I ask

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:21.610
why they fought?

00:09:22.244 --> 00:09:23.680
It was because of overtime work.

00:09:23.888 --> 00:09:25.820
Ms. Ye agreed
to help Ms. Wang work overtime

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:27.210
but she didn't do it.

00:09:27.266 --> 00:09:28.822
So, both of them had an argument.

00:09:31.066 --> 00:09:33.333
Is she the one who has been
asking you to work overtime?

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:35.460
That's not right.

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.730
What do you mean by
keep asking her to work overtime?

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:39.290
She did it willingly.

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:40.940
Willingly.

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:45.010
Did you agree to it?

00:09:49.955 --> 00:09:51.622
Forget it. I've already apologized.

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:55.180
No.

00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:57.770
Officer, look at his attitude.

00:09:57.770 --> 00:09:58.610
Apologize to her.

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:02.370
What did you say?

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:04.220
I'm asking you to apologize to her.

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:06.220
I'm not apologizing.

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:08.340
Why should I apologize to her?

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:09.369
What a joke this is.

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:11.133
You're asking her
to work overtime all the time.

00:10:11.133 --> 00:10:11.800
She refused you.

00:10:11.822 --> 00:10:13.300
Why are you causing her trouble then?

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:15.220
Besides, regardless of

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:17.010
who started the fight,

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:18.300
she still got hurt, right?

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:20.770
You caused the trouble
and beat her up in this state.

00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:22.490
I want you to apologize to her now!

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:23.890
I'm not apologizing! So what?

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:25.770
- Are you trying to scare me?
- Try it!

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:27.260
Stop shouting!

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:28.490
What are you doing?

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:29.730
Quiet!

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:30.570
Sit down!

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:46.570
Sorry.

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:48.530
All right.

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:49.850
We've apologized now.

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:54.850
All right. Wang Lin has apologized now.

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:57.220
If you agree to settle,

00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:58.490
let's sign another agreement.

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:01.730
Here you go.

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:02.777
It must be tough on you.

00:11:02.777 --> 00:11:03.370
Over here.

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:06.260
Sign it.

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:12.420
(Involved Party's Opinion:
Agree to mediate)

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:25.060
(Involved Party's Signature: Ye Sibei)

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:45.900
(Guantian Police Station)

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:47.850
Sorry.

00:11:49.488 --> 00:11:51.088
I made you come all the way here.

00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:53.690
Ye Sibei,

00:11:54.866 --> 00:11:57.244
don't apologize
if you didn't do anything wrong

00:11:57.980 --> 00:11:58.940
in the future.

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:09.850
Let me send you home.

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:11.770
No need.

00:12:12.530 --> 00:12:13.940
I need to return to the office.

00:12:14.133 --> 00:12:15.490
Let me send you back to the office.

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:19.180
I can go back on my own.

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:21.530
Dad called me today.

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:23.100
He said

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:24.220
his birthday is in two days

00:12:24.555 --> 00:12:26.066
and asked us to visit him together.

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:28.220
Find an excuse to reject him.

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:29.288
I promised him we'll go.

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:43.340
I'll find the right time
to tell them everything.

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:46.850
When you are free,

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:48.888
you may come home
to get the divorce agreement.

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:51.730
I've signed it.

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:54.530
I'll be leaving then.

00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:17.420
Talk to her.

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:30.220
I've been in the company for so long

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:33.100
and I've never felt so aggrieved.

00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:34.770
That's enough.

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:47.850
This car is using
the tires you asked about.

00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:05.430
Sibei.

00:14:05.555 --> 00:14:07.555
Get in.
Let me take you back to the office.

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:12.300
Hurry up. I can't park here.

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:25.490
Sibei,

00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:27.770
are you

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:29.300
having any troubles at home?

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:31.530
If you have any trouble,
you need to tell me.

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:33.422
I'll try to help you out
as much as possible.

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:36.780
It's nothing.

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:40.770
I was thinking about this.

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:43.530
With your personality,

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:45.890
you wouldn't have hit someone,

00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:46.730
right?

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:52.010
Wang Lin

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:54.250
was too agitated.

00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:57.420
She insisted that the company

00:14:57.420 --> 00:14:58.530
deal with this strictly.

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:03.580
Deal with what?

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:06.940
It's nothing.

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:10.770
However, I mean

00:15:10.770 --> 00:15:13.300
you should take a break at home
for a few days.

00:15:14.488 --> 00:15:16.133
Mainly, it's to give me some time

00:15:16.155 --> 00:15:17.377
to comfort her.

00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:19.530
Mr. Fan,

00:15:19.822 --> 00:15:21.866
I think I didn't do anything wrong
in this incident.

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:24.300
This has nothing to do
with being right or wrong.

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:25.420
In that case,

00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:26.820
why am I being punished?

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:31.650
This is not really a punishment.

00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:35.650
She gets off work
at five in the evening every day

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:38.420
and hands her work to me.

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:40.600
I've been working overtime
every day because of her.

00:15:40.822 --> 00:15:43.000
I didn't want to work overtime
because I had something to do,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:43.933
yet she wouldn't listen.

00:15:44.650 --> 00:15:46.530
Today, the report was not done in time

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:49.300
and she dragged me into a room
and scolded me in public.

00:15:49.820 --> 00:15:51.130
Don't you think that was too much?

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:53.650
Shouldn't she be punished?

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:57.180
This isn't a reason for you to hit her.

00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:59.060
Didn't she hit me as well?

00:16:00.488 --> 00:16:01.940
What punishment will she receive?

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:05.010
Or are you just punishing me alone?

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:08.130
You were the one who hit her first.

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:08.970
Yes.

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:12.060
I did hit her first.

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.350
However, you ignored the fact
that she asked me to work overtime

00:16:15.355 --> 00:16:15.933
every day.

00:16:16.133 --> 00:16:18.010
You ignored the fact
that she scolded me.

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:20.650
You ignored the fact that she hit me.

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:23.580
So why is the company
suddenly interfering

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:24.700
after I hit her?

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:29.180
What's this kind of attitude?

00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:30.060
Look at you.

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:03.650
What's wrong, Sibei?

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:12.290
What's wrong, Sibei?

00:17:15.511 --> 00:17:16.488
Was I the one who asked

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:20.311
to get out of the car
on the day of the gathering?

00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:22.370
Yes.

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:25.180
Didn't you ask me about it?

00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:30.050
What's wrong?

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:33.530
Let go of me!

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:36.940
(Let go of me!)

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:41.260
What are you doing?

00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:42.890
What are you doing?

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:44.660
It's not too far away.

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:46.770
I want to take a walk alone.

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:49.500
Sure. I'll unlock it for you.

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:52.570
Be careful.

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:27.100
(Money)

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:38.460
(Money)

00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:03.140
Ye Sibei.

00:20:04.577 --> 00:20:06.250
Mr. Fan is asking you
to go to his office.

00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:23.420
(Everything)

00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:27.060
(Your dream home begins here.)

00:20:48.533 --> 00:20:49.810
Mr. Fan, are you looking for me?

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:51.650
Sibei, you're here.

00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:53.890
Sit down.

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:05.380
You fought Wang Lin today

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:08.250
and affected the company badly.

00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:13.180
Fuqiang is a legitimate company.

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:15.290
If we allow our employees
to beat up others

00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:16.810
without taking action,

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:20.140
we'll become a hooligan company.

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:30.290
I hired you.

00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:33.250
Back then, I thought

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:34.770
you were

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:36.180
a smart and capable

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:37.250
university graduate

00:21:39.419 --> 00:21:40.260
who was obedient.

00:22:13.050 --> 00:22:13.900
All right.

00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:15.700
That's it.

00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:18.770
Go back and take a few days' break.

00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:21.140
Calm yourself down.

00:22:22.911 --> 00:22:24.660
You don't have to come to work for now.

00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:11.570
Nan.

00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:13.610
Chuchu?

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:14.930
Why are you here?

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:17.290
Do you have time?

00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:18.622
I want to have a chat with you.

00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:22.890
Enjoy.

00:24:24.711 --> 00:24:26.088
What do you want to talk about?

00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:29.090
Sibei...

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:32.290
She was sacked today.

00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:39.530
She has not been doing well recently.

00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:41.620
I've heard a little

00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:43.288
about what's going on between you two.

00:24:43.577 --> 00:24:45.600
It's not easy
for two people to be together.

00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:47.530
After you get married,

00:24:47.622 --> 00:24:49.090
you should manage your marriage.

00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:50.220
Are you here as a lobbyist?

00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:55.610
No need.

00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:57.330
I've thought it through.

00:24:57.911 --> 00:25:00.066
Forget about it
if that's all you're going to say.

00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:03.980
Nan,

00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:06.490
Sibei is a very nice person.

00:25:11.044 --> 00:25:13.050
When I was in high school,
I liked to make up.

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:16.290
I was bullied by other people in school.

00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:19.290
She and Nianwen
came to help me at my school.

00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:21.490
Back then,

00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:22.700
I had bad results

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:23.540
and I was foolish.

00:25:24.244 --> 00:25:26.330
Everyone thought I was from
the school of hard knocks.

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:28.044
I would surely
mess up my life in the future.

00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:30.090
However, she told me

00:25:30.555 --> 00:25:32.800
that a person would not
mess up in life at a certain moment.

00:25:33.022 --> 00:25:34.290
If I were willing to do it,

00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:35.730
I could study,

00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:38.730
so I admired her at that time.

00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:40.860
I thought she was amazing.

00:25:42.530 --> 00:25:43.810
When I was in high school,

00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:45.810
her mother asked her to work

00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:47.980
so Ye Nianwen could study.

00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:51.460
She got an aid from the school
to complete her high school studies.

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:53.050
Later, she went to university

00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:54.050
for four years

00:25:54.050 --> 00:25:56.000
and didn't ask for any money
from her family.

00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:57.620
After she graduated,

00:25:57.620 --> 00:25:59.620
she tried to find a job
in the provincial city.

00:25:59.622 --> 00:26:01.530
She did everything she could there

00:26:01.822 --> 00:26:03.860
and was finally brought back here
by her mother.

00:26:05.220 --> 00:26:06.220
This little city

00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:07.530
doesn't have many good jobs.

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:09.860
She was 23 years old when she came back.

00:26:10.530 --> 00:26:12.900
Her parents wanted her
to become a civil servant.

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:14.530
However, that was when

00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:17.860
Sibei started changing gradually.

00:26:20.044 --> 00:26:21.290
When I first went to her house,

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:22.810
I would always hear them arguing.

00:26:23.770 --> 00:26:25.000
They would complain about her

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.980
not getting a good job
despite being a university graduate

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:29.090
and how she couldn't find a boyfriend
until now.

00:26:29.666 --> 00:26:31.330
They even forced her
to go on blind dates.

00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:34.810
They said she was too arrogant

00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:36.530
and wasted her university studies.

00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:39.330
I felt bad as well when I heard that.

00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:42.810
It was as if all her hard work in life

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:44.090
was meaningless.

00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:47.050
I've been thinking about it many times.

00:26:47.050 --> 00:26:48.140
If I were in her shoes,

00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:50.980
I probably
wouldn't make it into university.

00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:55.220
So, Sibei has done a lot

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:56.730
to reach this stage.

00:26:57.460 --> 00:26:58.300
Nan,

00:26:59.250 --> 00:27:00.490
Sibei isn't

00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:01.770
what she looks like now.

00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:04.490
She is only at her lowest point in life.

00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:05.844
She needs someone to support her.

00:27:05.866 --> 00:27:07.290
If you give her a boost, you'll...

00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:08.130
I'm done.

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:10.010
Do you have anything else to say?

00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:14.050
Qin Nan.

00:27:14.770 --> 00:27:17.050
Do you really have
no feelings for her at all?

00:27:17.050 --> 00:27:19.422
When you hear all these,
don't you feel like pitying her

00:27:19.466 --> 00:27:20.700
and helping her?

00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:22.140
Everyone has their own difficulties.

00:27:23.933 --> 00:27:25.220
I told her countless times

00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:26.380
to live her life well.

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:29.860
However, she gave up on her life first.

00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:32.140
Who else can help her?

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:35.010
What do you mean
by giving up on her own life?

00:27:35.530 --> 00:27:37.570
She would choose
every hairband seriously,

00:27:37.570 --> 00:27:40.140
use different cups
for drinking water and tea,

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:41.180
and even when she was drunk,

00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:42.040
she told me

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:44.290
she wanted to live her life with you.

00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:45.940
No one who is trying to give up on life

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:47.530
will do all these things.

00:27:47.530 --> 00:27:49.622
Qin Nan, have you really
tried understanding her?

00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:51.770
She isn't giving up.

00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:53.380
She had too much burden

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:55.177
and she struggled,
but you didn't see that.

00:27:57.810 --> 00:27:59.290
Did you think she was a coward

00:27:59.290 --> 00:28:00.330
at the police station today?

00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:02.220
Yes. You are not a coward.

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:03.444
You vented your frustration.

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:05.490
However, she was fired by her company.

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:14.000
You thought
she didn't handle things well,

00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:16.700
but if you were in her shoes one day,

00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:20.090
do you think you'd do better than her?

00:29:07.381 --> 00:29:10.421
(Everything I Never Told You)

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:15.780
(In our lives, we must find ourselves
and escape other people's expectations)

00:29:15.810 --> 00:29:17.460
(We are alone,)

00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:18.420
(brave,)

00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:19.380
(angry,)

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:20.530
(bright,)

00:29:20.530 --> 00:29:22.620
(never wavering.)

00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:24.090
We fight,

00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:25.010
we work hard,

00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:26.290
and we resist,

00:29:26.290 --> 00:29:28.490
to overcome the darkest moments.

00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:31.220
The bright future
is within touching distance.

00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:33.330
There are no difficulties
that cannot be overcome.

00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:35.810
There's no despair that won't pass.

00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:38.090
Don't lose every step of confidence

00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:40.700
and abandon every dream.

00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:43.290
Your firm belief
is always in your hands.

00:29:43.290 --> 00:29:46.770
The most wonderful moment
will always be found in the future.

00:29:46.770 --> 00:29:49.220
I am Ye Sibei from Year 1 Class 7.

00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:51.090
I will never give up

00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:53.290
on becoming a better self.

Can a person's fate

really be changed?

00:30:19.010 --> 00:30:19.850
Well,

00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:21.220
you spoke well today.

It's possible.

Qin!

00:30:44.090 --> 00:30:45.540
Open the door for me.

00:30:58.210 --> 00:30:59.090
All right. I'm in.

00:30:59.090 --> 00:31:00.050
Shut the door.

00:31:00.050 --> 00:31:01.490
Why are you here at midnight?

00:31:01.911 --> 00:31:02.980
You were asleep, right?

00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:04.220
Sorry.

00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:05.330
I've disturbed your sleep.

00:31:06.090 --> 00:31:07.090
This is urgent.

00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:08.220
What is it?

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:09.330
I found the video.

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:10.740
You must

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:12.460
help me confirm it.

00:31:16.090 --> 00:31:17.290
Let me show you.

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:20.220
Just take a look, that's all.

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:21.810
Don't tell anyone about it.

00:31:21.810 --> 00:31:23.111
I'm not watching then. Go back.

00:31:23.644 --> 00:31:25.066
Why are you behaving like this?

00:31:25.111 --> 00:31:27.730
You're here at midnight
because you want me to identify the car.

00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:28.980
Yes.

00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:30.010
I trust you.

00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:31.290
I trust you, all right?

00:31:31.290 --> 00:31:32.130
Show me.

00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:33.290
Seriously.

00:31:33.290 --> 00:31:34.810
What's that

00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:35.650
attitude of yours?

00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:39.010
Every second counts in an investigation.

00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:39.850
I'm sure you know.

00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:42.010
I must find evidence quickly

00:31:42.010 --> 00:31:43.770
and persuade the involved party
to file a case.

00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:46.010
Otherwise, I wouldn't
find you at midnight.

00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:47.570
Here it is.

00:31:51.290 --> 00:31:52.980
Where did you get this video?

00:31:54.577 --> 00:31:56.066
I can only see the roof.

00:31:56.088 --> 00:31:57.220
How can I identify the car?

00:31:57.220 --> 00:32:00.050
It's good enough
that I found a video to see the roof.

00:32:00.050 --> 00:32:02.460
They don't have cameras
like the city government does.

00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:03.700
My colleagues and I

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:05.530
went from door to door
to ask for this video.

00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:07.244
This is a camera
that the local villagers

00:32:07.244 --> 00:32:09.090
used to prevent theft
in their farmlands.

00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:11.380
We found this footage from the cameras.

00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:12.980
Keep watching.
The video's quite long.

00:32:22.330 --> 00:32:23.470
Aren't you married?

00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:25.290
Why are you staying here?

00:32:25.290 --> 00:32:26.666
I'll be getting a divorce soon.

00:32:27.770 --> 00:32:28.610
Why?

00:32:29.555 --> 00:32:30.820
We are a bad match for each other.

00:32:31.666 --> 00:32:34.250
In that case, why would you get married
in the first place?

00:32:36.355 --> 00:32:37.620
She wasn't like this in the past.

00:32:40.570 --> 00:32:42.060
Qin, let me tell you.

00:32:42.730 --> 00:32:44.010
Two people

00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:46.180
must tolerate each other in life.

00:32:46.770 --> 00:32:48.010
Especially the man.

00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:49.250
He can't be too calculative.

00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:50.980
Otherwise, you'll suffer.

00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:52.330
Life is backing me into a corner.

00:32:52.355 --> 00:32:54.010
All of them
are backing me into a corner.

00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:55.980
I don't want anything.

00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:58.860
- I gave everything away.
- Look how drunk she was.

00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:01.570
I just want everyone

00:33:01.570 --> 00:33:03.330
to live well.

00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:04.570
Was I wrong to do that?

00:33:05.460 --> 00:33:07.290
I had a dream last night.

00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:09.290
I was back in high school

00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:12.090
and I thought

00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:13.140
life was really good

00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:14.090
back then.

00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:17.290
I did the flag-raising speech

00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:19.620
and everyone was looking at me.

00:33:21.330 --> 00:33:22.770
However,

00:33:22.770 --> 00:33:25.810
I've never
felt that way again after that.

00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:30.860
I really want
to live my whole life with him.

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:35.570
I don't know what it feels like
to like someone or not.

00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:41.420
I can't feel it but I really want
to live my life with him.

00:33:42.090 --> 00:33:44.330
Why is it so difficult?

00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:47.620
There's a reason for everything.

00:33:48.330 --> 00:33:50.140
Nothing changes for no reason.

00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:52.180
Just wait.

00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:52.860
Look at the door.

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:54.090
Here it comes.

00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:58.090
You're going to watch it again?

00:33:58.090 --> 00:33:58.930
Sure. Go ahead.

00:34:00.180 --> 00:34:03.900
I don't know what it feels like
to like someone or not.

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:09.820
I can't feel it but I really want
to live my life with him.

00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:11.860
Why is it so difficult?

00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:12.650
This is it.

00:34:12.650 --> 00:34:13.490
Look.

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:14.700
It's coming.

00:34:15.610 --> 00:34:16.460
There it is.

00:34:17.222 --> 00:34:18.866
Why do you keep rewinding the footage?

00:34:18.955 --> 00:34:20.170
I want you to look at the car.

00:34:20.170 --> 00:34:21.740
The front is not important.

00:34:22.210 --> 00:34:25.900
But I really want
to live my life with him.

00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:28.860
Why is it so difficult?

00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:33.900
The car is here. Get in.

00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:34.740
Get inside.

00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:40.580
This is the car.

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:42.820
Take a look.

00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:44.140
Is it this car?

00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:48.050
Yes. It's this car.

00:34:50.622 --> 00:34:52.555
This is also the car
in the rapeseed flower field.

00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:53.900
That's great!

00:34:57.980 --> 00:34:58.650
Qin,

00:34:58.650 --> 00:34:59.490
thank you.

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:01.380
You've been a great help.

00:35:02.570 --> 00:35:03.410
I'm leaving.

00:35:03.488 --> 00:35:04.690
I've disturbed your rest.

00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:05.610
Go to sleep.

00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:08.420
Qin,

00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:09.490
open the door for me.

00:35:12.090 --> 00:35:13.570
I've disturbed your rest, Qin.

00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:14.420
Sorry.

00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:15.130
All right.

00:35:15.130 --> 00:35:16.090
That's good enough.

00:35:16.090 --> 00:35:16.900
I'm leaving.

00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:17.740
Goodbye.

00:35:30.610 --> 00:35:31.490
Let's get a divorce.

00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:33.570
I won't do it.

00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:35.740
(When you are free,)

00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:37.911
(you may come home
to get the divorce agreement.)

00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:39.170
I've signed it.

00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:43.490
(But I really want
to live my life with him.)

00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:45.900
(Why is it so difficult?)

00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:49.820
(When will this end?)

00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:51.740
(Have you really
tried understanding her?)

00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:53.050
She isn't giving up.

00:35:53.050 --> 00:35:54.111
She had too much burden

00:35:54.133 --> 00:35:55.980
and she struggled,
but you didn't see that.

00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:57.740
(Fuqiang Real Estate)

00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:15.940
(Fuqiang Real Estate)

00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:40.940
Who are you?

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:41.900
Is the car yours?

00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:43.260
It's mine!

00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:44.970
Wait,

00:37:45.130 --> 00:37:46.740
did I scratch your car, Sir?

00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:47.900
Just tell me.

00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:48.860
I'll compensate you.

00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:51.690
Were you driving this car

00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:54.090
on the 9th of April?

00:37:56.420 --> 00:37:57.300
Talk!

00:37:57.690 --> 00:37:59.900
Did you bring Ye Sibei
to the rapeseed flower field?

00:38:05.570 --> 00:38:06.860
I know who you are!

00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:09.980
What are you doing?

00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:13.420
I know who you are!

00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:24.650
She did it willingly!

00:38:25.650 --> 00:38:26.650
She did it willingly!

00:38:27.288 --> 00:38:28.755
She drank and got in my car.

00:38:28.755 --> 00:38:31.610
She told me she liked me
and said you treated her badly.

00:38:31.947 --> 00:38:33.657
Everyone saw and heard it.

00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:34.900
They can prove it!

00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:37.460
What if she drank and got in your car?

00:38:38.130 --> 00:38:39.340
Are you mad?

00:38:40.610 --> 00:38:42.050
If she didn't do it willingly,

00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:43.130
why would she get in my car?

00:38:43.490 --> 00:38:44.900
Why would she drink so much?

00:38:44.900 --> 00:38:46.244
Why would she say she liked me?

00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:48.090
I'm right even if we go to court.

00:38:50.911 --> 00:38:52.820
Do you think
she dared not report to the police?

00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:55.740
Report to the police?

00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:57.820
What?

00:38:58.340 --> 00:38:59.570
That was why you chose her.

00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:04.340
Speak!

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:05.780
Beat me up.

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:07.780
Beat me to death.

00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:09.820
If this blows up,

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:11.900
it'll look bad for both of us.

00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:17.340
Let me see

00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:18.940
how a rapist

00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:21.900
dares speak to me about looking bad.

00:39:23.490 --> 00:39:24.420
I'm telling you.

00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:25.740
I'll make you

00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:28.170
return what you owe her in prison!

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:47.090
Good morning, Chen.

00:39:47.090 --> 00:39:47.960
Morning.

00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:48.900
Morning.

00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:50.610
Chen Xiaoyang.

00:39:50.610 --> 00:39:51.570
- What happened to Mr. Fan?
- Why did he...

00:39:51.570 --> 00:39:52.170
Was it serious?

00:39:52.170 --> 00:39:53.210
I don't know.

00:39:53.210 --> 00:39:54.420
He was holding his stomach,

00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:55.690
but he didn't go to the hospital.

00:39:55.690 --> 00:39:56.900
I wonder if he hurt his ribs.

00:39:56.900 --> 00:39:58.490
Why didn't he go to the hospital?

00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:00.420
- I don't know.
- Who's going to the hospital?

00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:01.380
This morning,

00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:03.490
Ms. Ye's husband beat up Mr. Fan.

00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:05.860
He is furious right now.

00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:07.050
You are close to Ms. Ye.

00:40:07.050 --> 00:40:08.170
You should avoid him.

00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:09.010
I'll be leaving.

00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:10.170
Are his injuries...

00:40:10.170 --> 00:40:11.420
Let's go.

00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:15.780
(Chuchu)

00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:19.420
Do you miss me, Dear?

00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:21.210
Nianwen, it's terrible.

00:40:22.690 --> 00:40:23.530
What happened?

00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:25.740
When I arrived at the office,
I heard my colleagues

00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:28.050
saying Nan beat up
my superior, Fan Jiancheng.

00:40:28.050 --> 00:40:28.900
What about Sibei?

00:40:29.050 --> 00:40:30.210
Did she go to the office?

00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:32.100
No. Yesterday, she...

00:40:34.010 --> 00:40:35.300
She was fired.

00:40:38.490 --> 00:40:39.330
I understand.

00:40:40.380 --> 00:40:41.666
Chuchu, stop Fan Jiancheng

00:40:41.688 --> 00:40:43.060
from making a police report.

00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:43.940
How can I do that?

00:40:44.490 --> 00:40:45.330
Hello?

00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:46.590
Hello?

00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:01.460
(Do you think)

00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:03.420
(an apology can solve all our problems?)

00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:05.570
I don't mean that.

00:41:05.570 --> 00:41:07.460
Have you thought about our future?

00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:10.100
Ye Sibei,

00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:12.690
you shouldn't lead a life like this.

00:41:13.201 --> 00:41:14.681
You've been fixing it every day

00:41:14.844 --> 00:41:16.666
and I've been waiting for you every day.

00:41:17.177 --> 00:41:18.210
Finally, most of the petals

00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:20.490
have fallen
and only three are remaining.

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:22.740

00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:23.940
