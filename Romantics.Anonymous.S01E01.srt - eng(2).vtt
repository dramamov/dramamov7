Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org

00:00:45.083 --> 00:00:45.916
All right!

00:01:04.375 --> 00:01:06.791
Twenty-four degrees Celsius.

00:01:31.583 --> 00:01:33.250
Beautiful.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.458
What are you doing?

00:02:26.541 --> 00:02:29.666
I wanna thank
our anonymous genius chocolatier.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.000
No, w-wait a second!

00:02:35.208 --> 00:02:37.750
Aw, man. I was too late.

00:02:38.541 --> 00:02:41.875
If you try to see their face,
they'll never work with us again.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.541
-Come on.
-Ow.

00:02:43.625 --> 00:02:45.291
Let's hurry and get ready to open.

00:02:45.791 --> 00:02:47.041
Yes, ma'am.

00:02:54.583 --> 00:02:58.208
You know who they are, don't you, Mama?

00:02:59.333 --> 00:03:00.666
Not a clue.

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.666
Only the owner knows.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.791
Come on, let's go.

00:03:14.791 --> 00:03:16.833
Here you go, Chief.

00:03:16.916 --> 00:03:18.250
-Thanks.
-Sure.

00:03:28.791 --> 00:03:29.916
Here it is, sir.

00:04:55.416 --> 00:04:59.250
RAINBOW PALETTE

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.541
Hello, thank you for waiting.

00:05:06.541 --> 00:05:10.208
We're now open for business.
Please come in!

00:05:12.125 --> 00:05:13.791
This is a seven-piece set…

00:05:13.875 --> 00:05:15.750
They're all cute! Which should we get?

00:05:15.833 --> 00:05:17.083
Anything you like.

00:05:17.166 --> 00:05:18.958
-Which one?
-I can't decide.

00:05:19.041 --> 00:05:20.291
Let's see.

00:05:20.375 --> 00:05:21.750
What do you recommend?

00:05:21.833 --> 00:05:24.000
The Pure Kenji on the bottom right.

00:05:24.083 --> 00:05:28.291
It looks simple, but it has two layers,
and the chocolate is delicious.

00:05:28.375 --> 00:05:29.875
That sounds so good!

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.250
Thank you for waiting.

00:05:38.333 --> 00:05:40.083
-Here you go.
-Wow, how cute!

00:05:40.166 --> 00:05:42.416
-The seating area is over there.
-Thank you.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:43.833
Enjoy.

00:05:44.416 --> 00:05:46.916
Thank you for coming, as always.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.541
Thank you. I'll be back.

00:05:48.625 --> 00:05:50.458
We'll be looking forward to it.

00:05:50.541 --> 00:05:52.375
-Thank you for waiting.
-Here it is.

00:05:52.458 --> 00:05:53.291
Okay.

00:05:53.375 --> 00:05:56.125
Whoa, the chocolate's all melty!

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.541
Look. That's so cool! She's mixing it.

00:06:00.625 --> 00:06:03.583
I wonder what they're making
with that chocolate.

00:06:03.666 --> 00:06:05.791
-I'll try yuzu next.
-Lucky you!

00:06:06.291 --> 00:06:08.291
-Yum!
-I'm so jealous!

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.583
-Can you take a picture?
-Sure.

00:06:24.208 --> 00:06:26.625
LE SAUVEUR
A PREMIER CHOCOLATE BOUTIQUE

00:06:26.708 --> 00:06:29.666
THE CHOCOLATE BONBON WAS SO GOOD.
I ATE TOO MANY, LOL.

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.083
BEST CHOCOLATE I'VE EVER HAD

00:06:35.166 --> 00:06:37.333
PURE KENJI IS JUST TOO GOOD!

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.250
It's good, huh? Super tasty, right?

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.083
Unlike handmade brand-name chocolates,

00:06:49.583 --> 00:06:51.833
our chocolates at Futago Confectionery

00:06:51.916 --> 00:06:55.166
tend to be seen as the kind
piled in discount bins.

00:06:56.208 --> 00:06:59.458
That's why I'm here today

00:06:59.958 --> 00:07:03.166
to propose a rebranding
of Futago Chocolate.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.666
A new brand that aims
to make premium chocolate

00:07:07.166 --> 00:07:09.458
more accessible to everyone.

00:07:09.541 --> 00:07:12.291
Allow me to introduce Futago Black.

00:07:20.333 --> 00:07:24.916
I heard you recently turned down
a deal for low-cost ingredients.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.333
Is that true?

00:07:26.416 --> 00:07:27.333
Yes.

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:31.750
We can't use cacao that isn't produced
through legitimate means.

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:34.500
I'll find another option right away.

00:07:35.791 --> 00:07:37.750
Even if you do,

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:43.125
using expensive ingredients generously
surely makes the chocolate taste good.

00:07:43.625 --> 00:07:45.208
Anyone can do that.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.541
Our products stand out

00:07:47.625 --> 00:07:50.833
for their affordability,
making them accessible to all.

00:07:50.916 --> 00:07:52.250
We take pride in that.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.166
And I won't change that.

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:55.916
You're absolutely right, Chairman.

00:07:56.416 --> 00:07:58.416
My goal is to create the ideal product.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:03.333
Affordable, yet top-class
in both taste and quality.

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.750
If that kind of contradiction
were possible,

00:08:07.833 --> 00:08:09.666
life would be a lot easier.

00:08:15.041 --> 00:08:18.541
Even so, the future
is born from contradiction.

00:08:18.625 --> 00:08:20.125
And-- Oh.

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:46.625
I'm so sorry!

00:09:06.958 --> 00:09:08.166
Sosuke.

00:09:10.791 --> 00:09:11.875
Sosuke.

00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:12.000
Shunsuke.

00:10:12.791 --> 00:10:15.041
Take this medicine and get better, okay?

00:10:15.125 --> 00:10:18.000
Yeah. I'll take it and feel better.

00:10:26.583 --> 00:10:28.500
If that's my medicine, I want more.

00:10:32.125 --> 00:10:33.208
Sure.

00:10:34.166 --> 00:10:35.708
I've got plenty.

00:10:36.458 --> 00:10:37.666
Okay, here you go.

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:38.875
All right.

00:10:38.958 --> 00:10:39.791
That's a lot.

00:10:40.708 --> 00:10:41.541
Right?

00:10:41.625 --> 00:10:42.875
Let's eat it together.

00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:44.541
-Okay.
-The medicine.

00:10:44.625 --> 00:10:47.208
Medicine. I'll take one.

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:50.083
Yum.

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:59.416
STERILE ROOM 301
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

00:11:09.375 --> 00:11:10.416
Come in.

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:13.500
Are you okay?

00:11:13.583 --> 00:11:15.875
How could I be?

00:11:16.458 --> 00:11:18.750
That was an important presentation.

00:11:19.333 --> 00:11:21.291
Man, the chairman's tough, huh?

00:11:21.375 --> 00:11:25.291
That's probably because
he has high hopes for you as his son.

00:11:27.083 --> 00:11:30.875
Also, I'll be reporting to him
that you're starting counseling this week.

00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:32.250
There it is.

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:34.791
My only cousin, acting like a spy.

00:11:34.875 --> 00:11:36.916
A spy?

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.208
It's my job to support
my only cousin's mental health.

00:11:41.291 --> 00:11:43.750
-I'll update your calendar.
-Wait.

00:11:43.833 --> 00:11:47.125
I'll get a doctor's note soon
saying I'm fine.

00:11:48.125 --> 00:11:50.333
Looks delicious!

00:11:55.833 --> 00:11:57.916
Kenji's Miso Special!

00:11:58.458 --> 00:12:00.250
-Let's dig in!
-Go ahead.

00:12:00.958 --> 00:12:02.000
Let's eat.

00:12:02.083 --> 00:12:03.583
I'll eat well.

00:12:03.666 --> 00:12:04.500
Uh-huh.

00:12:08.375 --> 00:12:09.416
Next time,

00:12:10.458 --> 00:12:14.125
why not ask "Mr. Kendo" out for a meal?

00:12:14.958 --> 00:12:17.291
You know I could never do that.

00:12:17.375 --> 00:12:20.833
I prefer to admire him from afar.

00:12:20.916 --> 00:12:22.666
-Oh, thank you.
-Hmm.

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:25.625
I'm just worried, you know.

00:12:26.208 --> 00:12:30.750
A young woman like you,
always keeping to yourself

00:12:30.833 --> 00:12:32.958
without seeing anybody.

00:12:35.833 --> 00:12:38.083
Don't you get lonely sometimes?

00:12:39.041 --> 00:12:40.166
Nope.

00:12:42.208 --> 00:12:44.416
I get to work in a lovely kitchen

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.958
and spend every day
surrounded by chocolate.

00:12:47.041 --> 00:12:49.625
I'm living a happy life.

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:58.333
How about giving counseling a try?

00:12:58.916 --> 00:13:00.916
Were you even listening?

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:07.291
Well, even if scopophobia
is severe during childhood,

00:13:07.375 --> 00:13:11.375
apparently it tends
to get better with age.

00:13:12.916 --> 00:13:14.750
The "Butterfly Hug."

00:13:15.375 --> 00:13:16.833
"Butterfly Hug"?

00:13:16.916 --> 00:13:17.916
Yeah.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.916
You cross your arms

00:13:22.833 --> 00:13:23.958
like this.

00:13:24.458 --> 00:13:27.500
And make a butterfly.

00:13:29.125 --> 00:13:35.916
I am okay.

00:13:37.541 --> 00:13:38.791
I am…

00:13:38.875 --> 00:13:41.791
-Okay
-Okay

00:13:41.875 --> 00:13:42.833
I am!

00:13:44.166 --> 00:13:45.541
What?

00:13:46.291 --> 00:13:47.541
Do I really

00:13:48.583 --> 00:13:51.166
look not okay to you?

00:13:53.208 --> 00:13:54.125
Hmm.

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:09.166
That day, during the competition
I had mustered up the courage to enter,

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:12.333
I realized how serious my symptoms were.

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:19.666
I wasn't just uncomfortable
with being stared at.

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:23.375
I felt suffocated. My heart was racing.

00:14:23.458 --> 00:14:25.791
I didn't even feel alive.

00:14:47.458 --> 00:14:52.708
And just like that,
I ruined the most important day

00:14:53.208 --> 00:14:55.041
of my life.

00:15:35.041 --> 00:15:36.666
"Le Sauveur."

00:15:39.458 --> 00:15:43.416
For your birthday this year,
which is on Valentine's Day…

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:44.333
Yes?

00:15:45.791 --> 00:15:47.375
How about Cielo?

00:15:47.458 --> 00:15:52.375
I heard their dessert menu is
full of homemade Belgian chocolates.

00:15:52.458 --> 00:15:55.166
What? I wanna go.

00:15:55.791 --> 00:16:00.041
But I get nervous
when people are watching.

00:16:00.125 --> 00:16:04.041
Hm? No, we've got
the whole place to ourselves.

00:16:04.125 --> 00:16:06.125
All of Cielo?

00:16:07.041 --> 00:16:08.250
You bet.

00:16:08.833 --> 00:16:11.666
Oh, and since it's your birthday,

00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:13.083
we're dining out.

00:16:13.166 --> 00:16:14.291
Really?

00:16:14.375 --> 00:16:16.291
-What should I do?
-Promise me!

00:16:16.375 --> 00:16:18.750
-I don't know.
-It's a promise.

00:16:18.833 --> 00:16:19.916
Promise?

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.125
Okay! I promise!

00:16:23.333 --> 00:16:24.625
Deal!

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:28.875
-See you.
-Good night.

00:16:34.833 --> 00:16:37.041
That was delicious.

00:17:01.125 --> 00:17:03.416
This one's called GlenAllachie.

00:17:03.916 --> 00:17:06.625
What kind of chocolate
would pair well with it?

00:17:22.375 --> 00:17:26.916
It's got a sweet sherry note,
with a lingering nutty aroma.

00:17:29.416 --> 00:17:30.958
How about Truffles Yuzu?

00:17:32.125 --> 00:17:35.166
I'd say it's quite the pairing.

00:17:35.250 --> 00:17:37.791
Aren't they a bit too different though?

00:17:37.875 --> 00:17:38.708
Huh?

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.833
No, they pair well
because they're so different.

00:17:43.666 --> 00:17:44.500
Oh.

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:49.041
Listen, I have a favor to ask.

00:17:49.791 --> 00:17:51.458
On Valentine's Day,

00:17:51.541 --> 00:17:54.333
how about having dinner together?

00:17:55.083 --> 00:17:56.291
At Cielo.

00:18:23.208 --> 00:18:24.625
KENJI SENT A VIDEO

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.250
What do I do?

00:18:32.875 --> 00:18:38.333
Gosh, watching stuff like this
might make me like jazz more than rock.

00:18:38.833 --> 00:18:41.166
Hiro!

00:18:48.791 --> 00:18:50.500
He really is divine.

00:19:08.541 --> 00:19:09.583
Men!

00:20:35.291 --> 00:20:39.625
Taking up kendo
was the best decision ever!

00:20:43.375 --> 00:20:46.625
"Fear of physical contact
is especially prominent."

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:53.166
If it's affecting your daily life
and relationships, like in your case,

00:20:53.250 --> 00:20:55.833
there's a high chance
it could be OCD, Sosuke.

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:58.291
You can't even touch hands, right?

00:20:58.375 --> 00:21:02.208
I thought you were a quack,
but it turns out you're a real doctor.

00:21:02.291 --> 00:21:04.500
Oh, now it makes sense.

00:21:04.583 --> 00:21:09.041
Back in college, you were
the only guy who ever turned me down.

00:21:09.916 --> 00:21:13.916
You were faking it, huh?
Acting all stuck-up and unapproachable.

00:21:14.416 --> 00:21:15.333
So, listen.

00:21:15.416 --> 00:21:18.250
I never sleep with the same guy twice.

00:21:18.333 --> 00:21:19.875
You still have a shot.

00:21:19.958 --> 00:21:21.583
Good luck with counseling.

00:21:21.666 --> 00:21:23.333
Forget counseling.

00:21:23.416 --> 00:21:25.833
Just write me a note
saying I'm fit to work.

00:21:25.916 --> 00:21:27.666
Without any counseling,

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:30.541
I can't write a note saying you're fine.

00:21:30.625 --> 00:21:34.833
I don't usually do counseling for friends,
but I'll make an exception for you.

00:21:34.916 --> 00:21:35.750
Here.

00:21:36.583 --> 00:21:37.416
What's this?

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:39.041
Come on, take it.

00:21:40.916 --> 00:21:42.666
Right this way.

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:46.000
We're just about to start
group counseling.

00:21:46.083 --> 00:21:48.416
No, that's not what I came for.

00:21:49.083 --> 00:21:49.916
"Luxury Tuna"?

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:51.875
I hate sushi.

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.750
I'd never eat something
made with bare hands.

00:21:54.833 --> 00:21:56.000
Mr. Luxury Tuna.

00:21:56.083 --> 00:21:58.208
Let's work hard so you can eat sushi.

00:21:58.291 --> 00:21:59.458
It's tasty.

00:22:01.083 --> 00:22:01.916
Hey.

00:22:02.416 --> 00:22:04.541
W-Wait up.

00:22:05.666 --> 00:22:06.500
Hey.

00:22:08.708 --> 00:22:10.583
I am okay.

00:22:11.083 --> 00:22:13.541
-I am okay.
-I am okay.

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:16.000
I am okay.

00:22:16.083 --> 00:22:19.791
-I am okay.
-I am okay.

00:22:20.583 --> 00:22:22.500
I am okay.

00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:27.583
-I am okay.
-I am okay.

00:22:28.083 --> 00:22:29.916
I am okay.

00:22:32.708 --> 00:22:38.333
I feel like my gloomy mood
has lightened up a little.

00:22:38.833 --> 00:22:40.041
Same here.

00:22:41.166 --> 00:22:45.666
I usually get angry easily
and have intense mood swings,

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:49.208
but doing this seems
to help calm my breathing.

00:22:51.458 --> 00:22:52.583
Doesn't it?

00:22:52.666 --> 00:22:53.500
Huh?

00:22:54.583 --> 00:22:55.791
Me?

00:22:59.416 --> 00:23:02.958
This is kind of like
a placebo effect, isn't it?

00:23:03.041 --> 00:23:06.041
When people gather,
they often sync with each other.

00:23:06.625 --> 00:23:07.875
But to be honest,

00:23:08.375 --> 00:23:11.083
without cognitive behavioral therapy
targeting the cause,

00:23:11.166 --> 00:23:13.208
there's no way to actually get better.

00:23:13.708 --> 00:23:18.541
Well, of course,
you might get some temporary relief.

00:23:23.250 --> 00:23:24.833
He's right. I'm not okay.

00:23:25.416 --> 00:23:26.916
I'm not okay at all!

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.166
There's no way I'll be okay.

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:31.125
What the heck am I doing?

00:23:31.208 --> 00:23:33.125
That's not true.

00:23:33.208 --> 00:23:34.333
I am okay.

00:23:34.416 --> 00:23:36.375
That's not true, is it?

00:23:36.958 --> 00:23:39.500
-Everyone, please calm down.
-Are you okay?

00:23:40.583 --> 00:23:43.375
Today is Valentine's Day.

00:23:44.708 --> 00:23:48.833
Our chocolates can help people
express their feelings

00:23:48.916 --> 00:23:53.833
to the ones they care for and love.

00:23:55.041 --> 00:23:58.291
It'll be a day to be proud of.

00:23:59.166 --> 00:24:02.333
With all our hearts, today and always…

00:24:02.416 --> 00:24:04.333
With all our hearts.

00:24:04.416 --> 00:24:06.125
…let's give it our all.

00:24:06.625 --> 00:24:08.208
We'll give it our all.

00:24:11.375 --> 00:24:12.666
What should I wear?

00:24:18.083 --> 00:24:20.041
Yeah, looks good.

00:24:21.166 --> 00:24:24.125
Maybe red? Hmm.

00:24:30.458 --> 00:24:31.583
Actually…

00:24:33.291 --> 00:24:36.083
Something safe.
Nothing that would stand out.

00:24:37.416 --> 00:24:38.750
Thank you.

00:24:45.041 --> 00:24:47.958
Welcome. Are you Ms. Kuroiwa
with the reservation?

00:24:48.041 --> 00:24:48.875
Yes.

00:24:48.958 --> 00:24:51.666
May I take your coat, ma'am?

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:54.333
Excuse me.

00:24:54.416 --> 00:24:55.875
Any valuables inside?

00:24:55.958 --> 00:24:56.833
No.

00:24:57.416 --> 00:24:58.291
Right this way.

00:24:58.375 --> 00:25:00.541
Okay, thank you.

00:25:02.583 --> 00:25:03.583
Yes.

00:25:03.666 --> 00:25:05.583
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

00:25:05.666 --> 00:25:06.791
Pardon me.

00:25:06.875 --> 00:25:07.708
Thanks.

00:25:43.541 --> 00:25:45.583
Chef, where are you?

00:25:46.083 --> 00:25:49.250
I seriously can't stand
being here anymore.

00:25:49.333 --> 00:25:54.250
Well, I've sent you
a Valentine's gift instead.

00:25:54.333 --> 00:25:55.750
He's not there yet?

00:25:55.833 --> 00:25:58.375
Oh, I'm sure he'll call you soon.

00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:02.083
Huh?

00:26:02.833 --> 00:26:04.166
A gift?

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.291
What did you do?

00:26:06.375 --> 00:26:08.875
No. No way. Absolutely not!

00:26:08.958 --> 00:26:11.208
-I definitely can't!
-Hey, listen.

00:26:11.291 --> 00:26:14.791
You can still fall in love
even if you can't make eye contact.

00:26:14.875 --> 00:26:16.500
Just sit next to him.

00:26:17.333 --> 00:26:19.541
W-Wait a second.

00:26:20.208 --> 00:26:22.125
Chef?

00:26:30.541 --> 00:26:33.250
-I told you, I can't do it!
-Oh, hello?

00:26:33.333 --> 00:26:36.625
Chef Kenji gave me your number,

00:26:36.708 --> 00:26:38.750
so I'm calling.

00:27:04.666 --> 00:27:05.833
Oh, no.

00:27:05.916 --> 00:27:06.750
Excuse me.

00:27:06.833 --> 00:27:08.875
-Do these flowers go--
-Um, this way.

00:27:08.958 --> 00:27:09.875
-That way.
-That way?

00:27:09.958 --> 00:27:11.166
-Th-This way.
-Huh?

00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:14.083
-Please take them to the entrance.
-Uh, okay.

00:27:14.166 --> 00:27:15.583
-This way.
-Okay.

00:27:16.083 --> 00:27:17.666
-Thank you.
-No problem.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:30.875
My coat.

00:27:40.708 --> 00:27:41.541
I'm cold!

00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:14.250
Why won't you answer?

00:28:14.833 --> 00:28:16.583
Are you mad at me?

00:28:17.791 --> 00:28:20.375
I hate myself for being like this too.

00:28:20.875 --> 00:28:24.500
But I really am okay being alone.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:28.833
Oh?

00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:31.666
Black Forest cake?

00:28:32.166 --> 00:28:33.500
So obvious!

00:28:34.083 --> 00:28:36.458
It's my birthday cake, isn't it?

00:28:48.583 --> 00:28:49.708
Chef?

00:28:50.916 --> 00:28:52.958
Chef? Chef!

00:28:53.458 --> 00:28:54.750
What's wrong, Chef?

00:28:54.833 --> 00:28:55.666
Chef!

00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:58.458
Come on, Chef. Wake up!

00:28:59.958 --> 00:29:01.083
What do I do?

00:29:06.958 --> 00:29:09.500
He collapsed and he's unconscious.

00:29:09.583 --> 00:29:11.125
Please help him!

00:29:11.875 --> 00:29:13.791
The location is Le Sauveur.

00:29:13.875 --> 00:29:15.833
Please hurry. I'm begging you!

00:29:17.083 --> 00:29:20.000
Chef!

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.916
Chef…

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.041
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, HANA

00:29:27.125 --> 00:29:28.791
What do I do?

00:30:50.583 --> 00:30:51.416
Come in.

00:30:52.708 --> 00:30:55.916
Excuse me. Do you have a moment?

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.083
Sure.

00:30:59.833 --> 00:31:04.291
Are you really planning
to acquire Le Sauveur?

00:31:05.708 --> 00:31:09.833
Kenji's widow needs
Futago Confectionery's support.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.708
And Le Sauveur's brand name and image

00:31:14.666 --> 00:31:16.625
has real value for us.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.125
In that case…

00:31:21.958 --> 00:31:24.750
could you put me in charge
of managing Le Sauveur?

00:31:24.833 --> 00:31:26.666
I can't do that.

00:31:28.125 --> 00:31:33.333
If the heir to Futago Confectionery
runs the place and suffers a loss,

00:31:33.875 --> 00:31:36.208
the damage to our image
would be too great.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.958
I believe the potential benefits
outweigh the risks.

00:31:43.333 --> 00:31:46.583
LE SAUVEUR
CONVENIENCE STORE EDITION PROPOSAL

00:31:46.666 --> 00:31:50.583
Even with Chef Kenji gone,
his techniques and recipes live on.

00:31:51.291 --> 00:31:54.083
To elevate
Futago Confectionery's chocolates,

00:31:54.166 --> 00:31:57.208
I intend to learn
all there is to know about Le Sauveur.

00:31:59.166 --> 00:32:01.000
We at Futago Confectionery

00:32:01.083 --> 00:32:05.208
have conducted a third-party allotment
of shares with Mrs. Kuroiwa,

00:32:05.291 --> 00:32:07.291
the widow of the late Kenji Kuroiwa.

00:32:07.916 --> 00:32:12.791
Mrs. Kuroiwa now holds 1.25%
of Futago Confectionery shares,

00:32:13.291 --> 00:32:18.583
and Futago Confectionery
has acquired 51% of Le Sauveur's shares.

00:32:19.166 --> 00:32:23.791
Therefore, as the new owner of Le Sauveur,

00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:28.541
we will do our utmost
to restore the business moving forward.

00:32:28.625 --> 00:32:31.041
Director Sosuke Fujiwara has stated that

00:32:31.125 --> 00:32:34.708
by bringing Le Sauveur
under Futago Confectionery's umbrella,

00:32:34.791 --> 00:32:37.250
they anticipate further business growth.

00:32:45.208 --> 00:32:48.750
BUTTERFLY HUG

00:33:23.125 --> 00:33:24.958
Dear Dr. Irene.

00:33:30.333 --> 00:33:31.500
Hello.

00:33:32.125 --> 00:33:36.875
I'm currently struggling
with severe scopophobia,

00:33:36.958 --> 00:33:40.583
and I've been living my life
avoiding interaction with others.

00:33:41.458 --> 00:33:46.791
But I don't want to live
this reclusive life anymore.

00:33:48.125 --> 00:33:51.166
So I gathered my courage
to write this email.

00:33:52.625 --> 00:33:53.916
Mom.

00:33:55.375 --> 00:34:01.875
There's no one left
I can look in the eye and talk to.

00:34:01.958 --> 00:34:03.083
Mom…

00:34:10.708 --> 00:34:12.333
Mom.

00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:33.416
WILL YOU COME WORK WITH ME?

00:34:39.083 --> 00:34:41.708
After my mom passed away,

00:34:42.208 --> 00:34:44.541
I stopped seeking treatment.

00:34:45.458 --> 00:34:50.125
I thought I could live
just fine on my own.

00:34:50.916 --> 00:34:54.208
But I finally realized

00:34:54.833 --> 00:34:57.750
I can't do anything by myself.

00:34:58.541 --> 00:35:01.166
Now that I'm truly alone,

00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:05.166
the reality of being
on my own terrifies me.

00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:06.458
If possible,

00:35:06.541 --> 00:35:09.875
I'd like to start counseling anonymously.

00:35:17.041 --> 00:35:18.000
They're here.

00:35:26.166 --> 00:35:28.375
Nice to meet you all.

00:35:29.375 --> 00:35:33.166
Starting today,
I'll be managing Le Sauveur.

00:35:33.666 --> 00:35:37.416
I'm Sosuke Fujiwara, the new president.

00:35:41.416 --> 00:35:45.791
To resume operations,
I kindly ask for everyone's support.

00:35:47.583 --> 00:35:52.458
I heard Chef Kenji
always greeted you with the same words.

00:35:53.583 --> 00:35:55.083
With all my heart,

00:35:55.666 --> 00:35:58.291
I look forward to working with you all.

00:36:01.791 --> 00:36:04.041
W-We look forward to working with you.

00:36:08.458 --> 00:36:10.375
Dear Anonymous Chocolatier,

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:15.458
I am currently working hard
to get Le Sauveur back on its feet.

00:36:15.541 --> 00:36:20.833
I am aware that your cooperation
is essential to that effort.

00:36:20.916 --> 00:36:25.000
"Therefore, I would appreciate
your cooperation."

00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:30.625
"Could we arrange an in-person meeting
at your earliest convenience?"

00:36:42.583 --> 00:36:44.875
Regarding the Anonymous Chocolatier,

00:36:44.958 --> 00:36:48.500
I plan to meet them in person
and terminate their contract.

00:36:48.583 --> 00:36:52.000
At the same time,
I plan to receive the recipes from them.

00:36:52.083 --> 00:36:55.916
I ask for your cooperation
to ensure the safe production

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.958
of the outsourced chocolates here.

00:36:58.833 --> 00:36:59.958
What?

00:37:03.916 --> 00:37:06.083
Is there a problem?

00:37:07.250 --> 00:37:08.083
No, sir.

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:11.375
Then I appreciate your support.

00:37:13.125 --> 00:37:17.666
Chef Kenji always worked
to protect the identity and role

00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:19.458
of the Anonymous Chocolatier.

00:37:19.541 --> 00:37:22.333
Could you reconsider
terminating their contract?

00:37:22.833 --> 00:37:23.875
Please.

00:37:24.375 --> 00:37:26.375
I understand what you're saying.

00:37:27.041 --> 00:37:29.833
However, maintaining a contract
with an unknown party

00:37:30.333 --> 00:37:32.875
isn't something
Futago Confectionery can accept.

00:37:53.583 --> 00:37:58.208
I am okay.

00:37:58.833 --> 00:38:00.208
I can do this.

00:38:06.333 --> 00:38:10.833
STAFF WANTED

00:38:15.791 --> 00:38:16.875
Um…

00:38:16.958 --> 00:38:18.583
Excuse me.

00:38:19.541 --> 00:38:22.375
"Policy disagreement"?
Why do you have to quit, Mama?

00:38:22.458 --> 00:38:24.166
I don't get it!

00:38:24.250 --> 00:38:25.750
If there's a conflict in policy,

00:38:25.833 --> 00:38:29.833
shouldn't the Anonymous Chocolatier
be let go first, not you?

00:38:31.416 --> 00:38:32.250
Oh.

00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:34.333
I'm sorry.

00:38:34.916 --> 00:38:37.583
We don't plan
to open Le Sauveur for a while.

00:38:37.666 --> 00:38:40.458
Um, I'm not a customer.

00:38:42.041 --> 00:38:43.125
I work…

00:38:45.250 --> 00:38:46.208
I mean…

00:38:47.875 --> 00:38:49.458
For a long time…

00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:53.625
Actually, I'm--

00:38:53.708 --> 00:38:54.541
Oh?

00:38:55.625 --> 00:38:57.125
Are you applying for a job?

00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:58.625
Yes!

00:38:59.833 --> 00:39:00.666
Huh?

00:39:02.666 --> 00:39:03.500
Follow me.

00:39:04.041 --> 00:39:05.625
-Did you know?
-Huh?

00:39:05.708 --> 00:39:07.333
They're already hiring?

00:39:07.416 --> 00:39:08.250
No way.

00:39:08.333 --> 00:39:11.833
So, you have no experience
with this kind of work?

00:39:13.875 --> 00:39:15.875
What did you do before?

00:39:15.958 --> 00:39:16.791
Yes.

00:39:17.625 --> 00:39:19.916
For a long time…

00:39:21.916 --> 00:39:24.750
I've been sort of unemployed.

00:39:24.833 --> 00:39:26.000
Sorry.

00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:28.000
Someone like me…

00:39:28.541 --> 00:39:29.958
I mean,

00:39:30.041 --> 00:39:31.291
I'm not qualified, right?

00:39:31.791 --> 00:39:32.750
Well, then.

00:39:33.416 --> 00:39:34.708
Why did you apply?

00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:37.958
How did you hear about this shop?

00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:41.250
Well, uh…

00:39:45.791 --> 00:39:46.708
Um.

00:39:47.791 --> 00:39:49.125
The thing is,

00:39:50.708 --> 00:39:52.291
I'm the…

00:39:58.916 --> 00:40:00.875
I've probably eaten

00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:04.541
about 10,000 chocolates from here.

00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:08.500
Whenever my heart ached,

00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:11.958
the chocolates from this shop
brought me comfort.

00:40:13.791 --> 00:40:15.083
Because of them,

00:40:16.416 --> 00:40:17.708
I was able…

00:40:20.375 --> 00:40:23.041
to feel a little happy.

00:40:25.083 --> 00:40:26.125
Your heart?

00:40:27.208 --> 00:40:29.250
My heart is all I've got.

00:40:30.708 --> 00:40:31.541
Well, then.

00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:33.541
If you'll excuse me.

00:40:35.333 --> 00:40:37.041
-You're hired.
-Yes.

00:40:38.541 --> 00:40:39.541
I'm hired?

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:42.458
She didn't even bring a résumé.

00:40:42.958 --> 00:40:45.708
We need someone who can start right away.

00:40:45.791 --> 00:40:48.291
In the server role you applied for,

00:40:48.375 --> 00:40:50.875
please do your best
with that happy heart of yours.

00:40:51.791 --> 00:40:52.875
W-What?

00:40:52.958 --> 00:40:54.375
-This way.
-Huh?

00:41:19.666 --> 00:41:24.041
N-No. I can't do this.

00:41:25.708 --> 00:41:27.083
Is something wrong?

00:41:28.041 --> 00:41:28.958
An dwaeyo.

00:41:30.291 --> 00:41:31.291
"An dwaeyo"?

00:41:31.375 --> 00:41:33.166
I-I can't do this!

00:41:33.791 --> 00:41:36.500
-I mean--
-Whoa! H-Hold on.

00:42:09.083 --> 00:42:11.333
One day, you'll meet someone

00:42:12.291 --> 00:42:15.916
you can lock eyes with
for as long as you want.

00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:20.791
That person is your soulmate.

00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:24.583
Or

00:42:25.083 --> 00:42:30.208
a villain who's so dangerous
your instincts warn you.

00:42:30.833 --> 00:42:32.291
A really bad guy.

00:42:32.791 --> 00:42:33.958
Bad guy?

00:42:37.208 --> 00:42:38.666
-Oh.
-Ow.

00:42:45.041 --> 00:42:46.291
Huh?

00:42:58.458 --> 00:42:59.791
Bad guy?

00:43:04.125 --> 00:43:04.958
What?

00:46:49.875 --> 00:46:52.708
