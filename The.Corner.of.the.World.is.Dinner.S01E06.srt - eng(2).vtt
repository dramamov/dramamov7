00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.400
Dear audience,

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.560
The exciting moment is about to come.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.919
Right now, by my side,

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:40.240
Nian'er, help me keep an eye on the ticket.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.680
I can only leave this on for fifteen minutes.

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:44.840
Let me freshen up a bit.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.639
You still haven't kicked your lottery habit.

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:49.080
This money's better spent on a cabbage.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.039
Why?

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.280
Cabbage sounds like "hundred fortunes."

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:55.400
If I win, I'll buy you a cabbage.

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:58.199
According to the lottery rules,

00:02:58.199 --> 00:03:01.400
we'll first draw six red number balls.

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:02.639
Let's look forward together

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:04.879
to the first red number ball being drawn.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.680
The first red ball is number one.

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.479
The second red ball is number eleven.

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:21.479
The third red ball is number twelve.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.680
The fourth red ball is number sixteen.

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:33.120
The fifth red ball is number eighteen.

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:38.120
The sixth red ball is number seven.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.479
What are you doing?

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:01.639
Is this a concert or a horror movie rehearsal?

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:03.840
You know I'm afraid of the dark.

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:05.639
Rehearsing Alien.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.280
Did you find any aliens in that corner?

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:10.240
We won the lottery!

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:14.319
What prize? Are you sleepwalking too?

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.639
No, no, no, the lottery prize!

00:04:18.399 --> 00:04:19.279
Are you sure?

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.040
Absolutely certain.

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:22.720
All the red balls matched.

00:04:26.839 --> 00:04:28.519
I'll go fix the circuit breaker first.

00:04:28.519 --> 00:04:29.839
Let's turn on the lights first.

00:04:31.519 --> 00:04:33.360
Don't turn on the lights. What if someone sees?

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.040
Right, right.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.439
We're in our own home.

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:36.600
What are you afraid people will see?

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.079
Our quality of life just changed.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.560
Should we hire a bodyguard?

00:04:57.399 --> 00:05:01.000
Li Zhenggui, can you not put your foot

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.639
inside my blanket?

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:05.759
Sorry about that.

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:07.480
My legs just go wherever it's warm.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.600
They stretch out on their own.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.399
I can't control them.

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:12.839
Why not try Nian'er's blanket instead?

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:15.920
My other leg's already there.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.199
You two still aren't asleep?

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:23.959
I just feel like the three of us

00:05:23.959 --> 00:05:26.279
sleeping on the floor for a lottery ticket

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:28.040
is kind of odd.

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:31.399
I'm just taking this chance

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:33.120
for us three to squeeze together.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.639
It's so cozy.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.920
Right now I feel

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:40.639
like in the freezing cold

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:43.199
and suddenly pushed into a warm bed.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.720
Nian'er, what are you talking about?

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:49.040
In the movie Call for Love,

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.040
the main character wins the lottery

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.319
and says this line.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.839
I just thought of a movie line too.

00:05:56.079 --> 00:05:59.279
Before, I only thought about getting through today.

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:04.279
Now I can plan for my future.

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:06.079
That's a good one.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.720
Zhenggui, why don't you say one too?

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.639
A movie quote about the lottery.

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:13.000
Let me think.

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:15.800
I want to use this money

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.759
for what I want to do,

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:20.279
not what others tell me to do.

00:06:21.399 --> 00:06:22.920
That line is so Zhenggui!

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.439
Did you just make that up yourself?

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:29.800
But it's really thanks to Zhenggui

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:31.439
that we're this lucky.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.160
Nian'er, can you do me a favor then?

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:39.879
What is it?

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.879
Call your Cong Ge right now.

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:44.560
Tell him you're taking a month off.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.279
Going to the Maldives for a month.

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:50.439
Isn't that a bit abrupt?

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:52.399
Maybe wait until we get the money first.

00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:54.319
No way, call Cong Ge at three a.m.?

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:55.720
Right now.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.759
I've been annoyed with him for ages.

00:06:57.759 --> 00:06:59.839
He really has no boundaries.

00:06:59.839 --> 00:07:01.720
He calls you nonstop, day and night.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:02.839
Always assigning you work.

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:04.199
That's just disrespectful to you.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.079
Fine, I'll call him now for payback.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.199
Hello, Cong Ge.

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:12.199
It's three in the morning.

00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:13.199
I'm calling to let you know

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:14.480
I'm taking a month off starting tomorrow.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.480
Don't wait for me at work.

00:07:16.439 --> 00:07:17.399
You really called him.

00:07:17.399 --> 00:07:18.199
I did.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.680
Oh wow, I can picture his face.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.000
This feels so good right now.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.879
Nian'er, there's no turning back now.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.079
Keep the lottery ticket safe.

00:07:26.079 --> 00:07:27.399
We'll cash it in first thing tomorrow.

00:07:27.399 --> 00:07:27.839
No problem.

00:07:27.839 --> 00:07:28.680
But I don't have the ticket.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:29.639
Isn't it with Zhenggui?

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:30.399
No, it's not.

00:07:30.439 --> 00:07:31.920
We said it's safer with her.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.279
You pile up so many clothes and don't wash them?

00:07:50.279 --> 00:07:51.000
I'll wash them, I'll wash them.

00:07:58.079 --> 00:07:59.639
You guys must be tired from searching too.

00:07:59.839 --> 00:08:01.199
I'll go make us a late-night snack.

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.720
Even a simple bowl of instant noodles

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.879
deserves to be made with care.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:15.600
Hui,

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.399
Am I sick or something?

00:12:19.759 --> 00:12:20.879
Why do I feel

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.240
that when I see her cooking now,

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:25.720
I have no appetite.

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.639
Shh, don't let Nian'er hear you.

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.679
Eat quickly, or the noodles will get soggy.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.240
This tomato tastes sweet and sour.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.879
The noodles are so springy—delicious!

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:27.919
Just right.

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.000
Who just said they had no appetite?

00:13:30.159 --> 00:13:31.879
But it really is tasty.

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:33.480
Feels like all the night's fatigue

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.399
has completely disappeared.

00:14:51.039 --> 00:14:52.200
I was just thinking,

00:14:53.639 --> 00:14:56.720
how did that lottery ticket

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:58.840
just vanish like that?

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:00.799
It's definitely still in this room.

00:15:00.799 --> 00:15:01.759
After we finish eating,

00:15:01.759 --> 00:15:02.720
let's look for it again.

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.679
Why are you washing clothes so late?

00:15:10.799 --> 00:15:12.039
I'm afraid I'll forget tomorrow.

00:15:17.399 --> 00:15:18.200
Clothes.

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.240
I know where the ticket is!

00:15:51.399 --> 00:15:52.679
It's a little wet.

00:15:57.879 --> 00:15:58.600
Hair dryer.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:59.279
No way.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
The hot air will make the ticket wrinkle.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:02.840
Then what should we do?

00:16:03.919 --> 00:16:06.519
How about we put it on a plate

00:16:06.519 --> 00:16:07.879
and try freezing it in the fridge?

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:28.919
Can we still cash it in like this?

00:16:35.039 --> 00:16:36.399
Let's just give it a shot.

00:16:46.159 --> 00:16:47.960
Why do I feel like we're not here to cash the ticket?

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:49.200
Feels more like we're here to put on a show.

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.360
We're about to collect so much money.

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.759
Of course we need to disguise ourselves.

00:16:52.759 --> 00:16:53.799
Just in case something happens.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:57.080
You should secretly watch over us.

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:58.159
In case robbers show up.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.200
Why does it feel like the three of us

00:17:16.519 --> 00:17:17.640
look like we're here to rob the place?

00:17:28.359 --> 00:17:29.160
Cheers!

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:38.000
Good thing Nian'er didn't call Cong Ge.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.119
Just pretending.

00:17:41.319 --> 00:17:42.880
Nian'er only pretended to quit.

00:17:43.559 --> 00:17:45.039
But I really took time off.

00:17:45.359 --> 00:17:46.440
I was late this morning.

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.480
There goes my perfect attendance bonus.

00:17:50.839 --> 00:17:51.640
Li Yihan

00:17:51.799 --> 00:17:54.559
He urged us old staff to all resign together.

00:17:54.559 --> 00:17:55.559
He said there's a company

00:17:55.559 --> 00:17:57.799
willing to hire our team for a high salary.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.039
I turned it down.

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:00.880
I'm loyal to my company.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:04.440
But I heard

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:07.319
that company offers a million a year to poach people.

00:18:07.319 --> 00:18:09.720
I really regret it now.

00:18:11.119 --> 00:18:12.160
Li Yihan, that guy—

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.039
he doesn't look like a good person.

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:16.039
I think it's fine not to go.

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:17.759
It seems like a good opportunity.

00:18:17.759 --> 00:18:19.240
But maybe it's a trap.

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:21.440
True.

00:18:25.799 --> 00:18:28.839
We got six red balls on the lottery.

00:18:29.039 --> 00:18:30.400
Missed the blue ball, but that's okay.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:32.079
Second prize is over ninety thousand yuan.

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:36.960
But the lottery staff

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:38.559
said our numbers aren't clear.

00:18:38.559 --> 00:18:39.640
The QR code won't scan.

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.000
They just won't let us claim the prize.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.240
Why are the three of us so unlucky?

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:52.279
By the way, this is my second time winning.

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:55.200
How much did you win the first time?

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:14.839
Hey, are you okay?

00:19:14.839 --> 00:19:16.240
I'm going to take the civil service exam.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.160
I've prepared for half a year.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:19.039
But I'm half an hour away from being late.

00:19:19.039 --> 00:19:19.839
I can't get a ride no matter what.

00:19:19.839 --> 00:19:21.279
Where's the exam location?

00:19:21.279 --> 00:19:21.960
Si Shi Qi Zhong.

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.640
Hop in, I'll drive you there.

00:19:27.079 --> 00:19:27.880
Thank you.

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:29.000
Are you seated?

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:30.519
I'm lucky you helped me.

00:19:30.519 --> 00:19:32.599
I made it to the civil service exam that day.

00:19:33.559 --> 00:19:35.039
Even though I didn't pass in the end,

00:19:35.279 --> 00:19:36.720
I'm still grateful to you.

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:38.119
I left in such a rush that day.

00:19:38.119 --> 00:19:40.279
I didn't get your contact info.

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:41.759
Funny thing is,

00:19:41.759 --> 00:19:44.359
I saw your name in a movie's credits recently.

00:19:44.359 --> 00:19:45.519
Your name was there.

00:19:45.759 --> 00:19:48.480
I remembered you told me your job.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.480
So I went to that film company.

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:51.519
Finally found out

00:19:51.519 --> 00:19:52.880
you actually live here.

00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:54.680
Thank you.

00:19:55.039 --> 00:19:57.279
You still remembered me after all this time.

00:19:57.599 --> 00:19:59.039
And you managed to find me.

00:20:04.119 --> 00:20:05.880
So are you here in Jiangzhou for work?

00:20:07.519 --> 00:20:09.480
I found a job in Jiangzhou.

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:11.519
I don't really want to go back home.

00:20:12.519 --> 00:20:16.279
Um, do you need a roommate?

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:18.480
I do.

00:20:54.119 --> 00:20:54.880
It's thirty yuan in total.

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:55.920
How should I pay?

00:21:01.119 --> 00:21:02.680
Sorry, my balance isn't enough.

00:21:05.759 --> 00:21:06.599
Try this one.

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:12.039
Still won't go through.

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:18.880
I'm here traveling.

00:21:19.359 --> 00:21:21.400
Maybe I spent too much these days.

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:23.880
I haven't asked my family for money yet.

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:25.640
Oh.

00:21:28.359 --> 00:21:30.039
So, that cup of coffee—

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:31.240
I still need to pay for it.

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:40.000
Here's a painting I did.

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.359
It could sell for a hundred or two online.

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:43.599
Take it.

00:21:44.039 --> 00:21:45.839
Thirty yuan for the coffee.

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:47.680
One hundred eighty as your tip.

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:52.240
Thirty plus one eighty is two hundred ten.

00:21:54.279 --> 00:21:55.079
Not bad.

00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:57.559
Sorry.

00:21:57.559 --> 00:21:59.000
We don't have that kind of rule here.

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.039
Nian'er

00:22:04.359 --> 00:22:07.160
This customer wants to pay for coffee with a painting.

00:22:12.599 --> 00:22:14.720
It's fine, the café belongs to our company.

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:15.839
Put it on my tab.

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:17.440
It's your first day at work.

00:22:17.599 --> 00:22:19.079
Don't let it ruin your mood.

00:22:20.599 --> 00:22:21.440
Wait a second.

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:25.880
Let's exchange contact info.

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.960
I'll pay you back ten times later.

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:32.200
Ten times?

00:22:33.599 --> 00:22:34.599
A hundred is fine too.

00:22:50.319 --> 00:22:51.119
Hui

00:22:51.599 --> 00:22:52.440
My Precious

00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:59.200
Missed you so much!

00:22:59.200 --> 00:22:59.920
It's you!

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.400
Nian'er, let me see the lease.

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:10.720
Ah.

00:23:11.839 --> 00:23:13.640
Real sisters, clear accounts.

00:23:18.599 --> 00:23:19.559
Actually, she secretly

00:23:19.559 --> 00:23:21.440
wrote down the landlord's contact info.

00:23:21.519 --> 00:23:23.200
Used her last savings

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.680
to pay three months' rent for us.

00:23:28.119 --> 00:23:29.160
I'll give it to you in a bit.

00:23:40.319 --> 00:23:42.200
I want the biggest room.

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.400
If you don't mind.

00:23:44.519 --> 00:23:45.319
I don't mind.

00:23:47.559 --> 00:23:50.599
Oh, and I sleepwalk sometimes.

00:23:52.279 --> 00:23:53.480
Help me with my luggage.

00:24:17.359 --> 00:24:18.599
In this world,

00:24:19.079 --> 00:24:21.680
only she calls me My Precious.

00:24:22.119 --> 00:24:23.000
My Precious

00:24:23.599 --> 00:24:25.680
But Nian'er, you still haven't said

00:24:26.559 --> 00:24:28.839
what you won the first time.

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:34.240
You two—

00:24:39.799 --> 00:24:40.759
A toast to the lottery.

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:41.799
A toast to dinner.

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:42.799
A toast to the three of us.

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:17.920
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:40.200
Life is like a grand lottery.

00:25:40.599 --> 00:25:43.279
Good friends are your lucky winning ticket.

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:46.440
They laugh with you when you're happy.

00:25:46.839 --> 00:25:50.200
They comfort you when you're down.

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:54.039
When trouble comes, we face it together.

00:25:54.359 --> 00:25:56.000
Then trouble isn't trouble anymore.

00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:58.880
We help and support each other.

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:01.359
No matter how hard or bitter things get,

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:03.240
they can turn sweet.

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:05.359
Even a little happiness

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:08.039
becomes a lot of joy.

00:26:09.119 --> 00:26:09.960
It's them

00:26:10.559 --> 00:26:12.039
who make these ordinary days

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:14.200
so vibrant and full of life.

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:34.920
I have a great idea.

00:26:35.319 --> 00:26:37.279
What crazy idea do you have now?

00:26:37.279 --> 00:26:38.119
Stop, stop, stop.

00:26:40.319 --> 00:26:43.319
Tonight, let's sleep on the floor again.

00:26:46.039 --> 00:26:47.839
Ah, please, I'm begging you.

00:26:47.839 --> 00:26:49.200
Please, please, please.

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:50.440
Please, you guys.
