Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org

00:00:29.458 --> 00:00:31.083
Whoa, scary.

00:00:34.375 --> 00:00:37.833
NOTICE OF POWER OUTAGE

00:00:38.708 --> 00:00:40.083
I'm done for.

00:00:46.708 --> 00:00:48.000
This is bad.

00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:42.458
All right!

00:02:03.416 --> 00:02:04.416
Oh, no.

00:02:42.041 --> 00:02:43.458
Hana?

00:02:45.375 --> 00:02:47.333
What are you doing here so early?

00:02:47.416 --> 00:02:48.250
Oh…

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.250
Um.

00:02:51.166 --> 00:02:54.083
Well, uh…

00:02:54.166 --> 00:02:57.000
-I think I dropped something.
-Huh?

00:02:57.583 --> 00:02:58.958
Good morning.

00:02:59.458 --> 00:03:01.000
-Good morning.
-That's odd.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.541
Hmm?

00:03:07.708 --> 00:03:08.708
Oh!

00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:21.041
I thought our practice was over.

00:03:21.541 --> 00:03:24.500
I think it's best to stop

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.375
for everyone's sake.

00:03:58.333 --> 00:04:01.583
PURE KENJI

00:04:02.166 --> 00:04:03.041
Could you…

LE SAUVEUR CLOSURE PLAN

00:04:04.291 --> 00:04:06.458
…give Le Sauveur another chance?

00:04:06.541 --> 00:04:07.500
Please, sir.

00:04:09.375 --> 00:04:13.375
Lately, I've been worried
about our major shareholders' moves.

00:04:15.583 --> 00:04:17.875
Even the smallest management misstep

00:04:18.375 --> 00:04:21.166
could be used against us
by them or the board.

00:04:21.666 --> 00:04:27.125
That's why Le Sauveur has to win
the World Chocolatier Masters.

00:04:27.666 --> 00:04:30.916
We'll prove we're the best in the world

00:04:31.416 --> 00:04:33.625
and bring profits to Futago Confectionery.

00:04:37.416 --> 00:04:40.333
Winning the World Chocolatier Masters?

00:04:41.583 --> 00:04:44.708
If you can prove your dream is right,

00:04:45.875 --> 00:04:46.916
I'll consider it.

00:04:49.083 --> 00:04:50.291
Thank you.

00:05:08.541 --> 00:05:09.375
Come in.

00:05:10.333 --> 00:05:11.708
Excuse me.

00:05:13.958 --> 00:05:16.541
Here's the entry plan
for the World Chocolatier Masters

00:05:16.625 --> 00:05:18.625
that you mentioned before.

00:05:18.708 --> 00:05:21.791
I brainstormed
with the other chocolatiers.

00:05:21.875 --> 00:05:25.083
We want to compete
with a slightly refined version

00:05:25.166 --> 00:05:27.250
of the Bonbon Sakura.

00:05:34.875 --> 00:05:37.125
It's a tough call,

00:05:37.208 --> 00:05:41.416
but let's go with Pure Kenji,
Le Sauveur's signature product.

00:05:44.833 --> 00:05:48.250
Do you mean we'll enter
the Anonymous Chocolatier?

00:05:48.916 --> 00:05:50.083
That's right.

00:05:50.583 --> 00:05:55.916
Le Sauveur must win
the upcoming competition.

00:05:56.416 --> 00:06:02.583
To do that, I believe we should pick
the best of the seven chocolates.

00:06:13.166 --> 00:06:17.458
Each shop’s head chocolatier enters,
so that should be you, Chief.

00:06:20.291 --> 00:06:23.166
It's the first competition
since Chef Kenji passed away.

00:06:24.833 --> 00:06:26.875
For Le Sauveur to win,

00:06:28.125 --> 00:06:33.708
we need someone
as skilled as the Anonymous Chocolatier.

00:06:36.208 --> 00:06:37.916
I can't accept that.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:55.666
Um,

00:06:56.291 --> 00:06:58.666
do we really need

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:03.875
the Anonymous Chocolatier
to help Le Sauveur?

00:07:05.833 --> 00:07:07.875
About that…

00:07:09.708 --> 00:07:11.250
I'm actually the--

00:07:12.458 --> 00:07:13.958
Chief, I heard about it!

00:07:14.041 --> 00:07:16.333
You should be the one to enter.

00:07:16.833 --> 00:07:20.916
I mean, all they do is sneak around
and never show up to work.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.333
Chef Kenji valued them for their talent.

00:07:23.416 --> 00:07:26.750
but you and the rest of us
have been doing all the work!

00:07:26.833 --> 00:07:28.375
Exactly.

00:07:28.875 --> 00:07:31.875
No matter how great
the Anonymous Chocolatier is,

00:07:32.541 --> 00:07:35.208
I won't back someone I don't know.

00:07:35.291 --> 00:07:36.708
Yeah, same here!

00:07:37.208 --> 00:07:42.958
I can't stand them
competing in my place either.

00:07:44.375 --> 00:07:48.208
But… for Le Sauveur's sake,

00:07:49.708 --> 00:07:51.208
we need their help.

00:07:53.541 --> 00:07:56.541
Gosh. I'm pathetic, huh?

00:07:57.166 --> 00:07:59.541
Chief, that's not true.

00:08:00.166 --> 00:08:02.166
Come on, Chief.

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:04.333
I'm gonna go talk to the boss.

00:08:16.125 --> 00:08:17.583
Excuse me, Chief?

00:08:19.583 --> 00:08:21.416
I have something to tell you.

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:25.333
I am…

00:08:27.833 --> 00:08:29.583
the Anonymous Chocolatier…

00:08:31.166 --> 00:08:32.000
I mean,

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.625
I can be their point of contact.

00:08:36.333 --> 00:08:37.791
You can?

00:08:37.875 --> 00:08:39.708
Wait, how?

00:08:39.791 --> 00:08:41.458
Truth is,

00:08:42.041 --> 00:08:45.375
I've been in touch with them now and then.

00:08:45.458 --> 00:08:47.750
What? Really?

00:08:47.833 --> 00:08:48.791
Uh, yes.

00:08:49.875 --> 00:08:52.291
I'm a big fan of Pure Kenji.

00:08:53.958 --> 00:08:56.916
So I'll try to convince them

00:08:57.916 --> 00:09:00.583
to share the recipe

00:09:01.166 --> 00:09:04.208
with Team Le Sauveur
before the competition.

00:09:05.291 --> 00:09:10.208
But I doubt they'll come here.

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:17.083
Then what if they teach us remotely?

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:23.166
Oh, seriously.

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:25.541
I mean, it's my fault
for saying I'd do this.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Okay.

00:09:46.333 --> 00:09:48.833
Okay, we're ready to begin.

00:09:49.333 --> 00:09:51.875
Thank you for joining us.

00:09:53.666 --> 00:09:54.500
Yes.

00:09:55.333 --> 00:09:56.458
Oh.

00:09:57.083 --> 00:10:00.958
The cacao beans
are mainly Peruvian Criollo,

00:10:01.041 --> 00:10:06.625
blended with Trinitario cacao from Koita,

00:10:06.708 --> 00:10:09.541
is what they're saying.

00:10:10.916 --> 00:10:11.916
Okay.

00:10:14.416 --> 00:10:16.750
As you all know,

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:22.250
conducting the whole process
from roasting to melanging

00:10:22.333 --> 00:10:24.833
would take us about four days.

00:10:24.916 --> 00:10:31.166
So I've been given
pre-blocked chocolate for today.

00:10:31.666 --> 00:10:32.541
Is it in here?

00:10:34.375 --> 00:10:35.500
Oh, here it is.

00:10:38.125 --> 00:10:38.958
Here you go.

00:10:39.458 --> 00:10:40.750
Thank you.

00:10:41.583 --> 00:10:43.541
Careful, it's hot.

00:10:50.708 --> 00:10:53.208
Oh, now! Please check the temperature…

00:10:54.541 --> 00:10:57.166
is what they're saying.

00:11:34.875 --> 00:11:37.208
It's the same Pure Kenji we know.

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:39.416
That's a relief.

00:11:40.041 --> 00:11:41.541
It's really good.

00:11:42.041 --> 00:11:43.791
Mind if I try one too?

00:11:43.875 --> 00:11:44.708
Go ahead.

00:11:48.291 --> 00:11:49.333
Thanks.

00:11:56.916 --> 00:11:58.166
It's delicious.

00:12:22.708 --> 00:12:26.791
Thank you so much
for sharing your precious recipe.

00:12:26.875 --> 00:12:28.791
Thank you!

00:12:28.875 --> 00:12:30.041
It's my pleasure.

00:12:30.125 --> 00:12:33.125
Please do your best
in making the best chocolate…

00:12:34.416 --> 00:12:35.916
is what they said.

00:12:37.916 --> 00:12:43.250
Okay, I'd like to end our remote call
with the Anonymous Chocolatier.

00:12:43.333 --> 00:12:44.708
We appreciate your time.

00:12:44.791 --> 00:12:46.583
Thank you for your time!

00:12:48.041 --> 00:12:49.500
Great work, everyone.

00:12:49.583 --> 00:12:50.791
Thank you.

00:12:50.875 --> 00:12:52.166
-Thank you.
-Thanks!

00:12:55.166 --> 00:12:57.250
Chief, go crush the competition.

00:12:57.333 --> 00:12:58.583
I got this.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.750
LE SAUVEUR CLOSURE PLAN

00:13:49.541 --> 00:13:53.125
Mr. Fujiwara, I noticed something odd.

00:13:53.208 --> 00:13:54.708
Hm? What is it?

00:13:54.791 --> 00:13:59.666
Hana's laptop wasn't connected
to any website today.

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:04.375
I checked her private IP address.

00:14:04.458 --> 00:14:06.750
Even though it's on Le Sauveur's Wi-Fi,

00:14:06.833 --> 00:14:10.125
there's no record of any web access today.

00:14:10.208 --> 00:14:13.708
What? But she gave us
real-time instructions.

00:14:13.791 --> 00:14:16.291
And thanks to her,
we managed to make Pure Kenji.

00:14:16.375 --> 00:14:22.000
That means Hana could teach
how to make Pure Kenji without any help.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.583
In other words,
she's the Anonymous Chocolatier.

00:14:28.083 --> 00:14:29.125
-Huh?
-What?

00:14:30.541 --> 00:14:31.416
What?

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Wait, are you serious?

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.750
The newbie's the genius chocolatier?

00:14:37.291 --> 00:14:39.291
W-Wait a second.

00:14:39.375 --> 00:14:41.708
Even if that's true,

00:14:42.208 --> 00:14:44.333
why lie about it all this time?

00:15:08.916 --> 00:15:10.583
Hana!

00:15:10.666 --> 00:15:12.333
Wait, Hana!

00:15:12.833 --> 00:15:16.041
Is it true what Takashi said?

00:15:16.125 --> 00:15:21.375
I just wanted to help Le Sauveur.

00:15:22.416 --> 00:15:25.625
But why did you lie about it?

00:15:26.541 --> 00:15:28.166
Th-That's…

00:15:29.625 --> 00:15:32.291
I tried to tell you so many times.

00:15:33.625 --> 00:15:36.458
Then why didn't you?

00:15:36.541 --> 00:15:39.333
I couldn't trust you then.

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:44.333
Hana…

00:15:44.916 --> 00:15:49.583
Just how much of you is real?

00:15:49.666 --> 00:15:51.208
What about you?

00:15:51.833 --> 00:15:54.375
You just wanted my recipe, didn't you?

00:15:54.958 --> 00:15:57.750
You came to steal Chef Kenji's recipe.

00:15:57.833 --> 00:16:00.500
You're planning to shut Le Sauveur down!

00:16:03.166 --> 00:16:05.250
I trusted you.

00:16:09.041 --> 00:16:11.083
No, that's not…

00:16:12.083 --> 00:16:16.041
I asked for everyone's help
to not let that happen.

00:16:16.125 --> 00:16:20.125
To save Le Sauveur,
we have to win this competition.

00:16:22.333 --> 00:16:23.750
-Hana.
-What's the matter?

00:16:24.416 --> 00:16:25.541
Taxi!

00:16:26.083 --> 00:16:27.958
We've got the recipe now.

00:16:28.666 --> 00:16:31.125
We don't need her anymore, do we?

00:17:43.166 --> 00:17:47.125
To save Le Sauveur,
we have to win this competition.

00:18:21.625 --> 00:18:23.458
Koita.

00:18:28.416 --> 00:18:32.958
Now then, please make sure
you're fully prepared for the competition.

00:18:33.041 --> 00:18:34.375
Mr. Fujiwara.

00:18:35.333 --> 00:18:36.166
Yes?

00:18:36.666 --> 00:18:37.958
I think

00:18:39.166 --> 00:18:41.333
for Le Sauveur's future,

00:18:42.208 --> 00:18:44.500
we need the Anonymous Chocolatier.

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:49.833
With everyone's help,

00:18:50.333 --> 00:18:53.166
I've done everything I can.

00:18:54.458 --> 00:18:55.416
But…

00:18:56.875 --> 00:18:59.000
the taste is slightly off.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.208
It might be difficult
to recreate the same flavor.

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:09.750
It hurts my pride,
but that doesn't matter.

00:19:10.416 --> 00:19:17.041
What matters more is protecting
our life here making chocolate.

00:19:18.250 --> 00:19:19.208
So,

00:19:20.416 --> 00:19:26.875
please help us persuade Hana
to enter the World Chocolatier Masters

00:19:27.458 --> 00:19:30.291
with her Pure Kenji.

00:19:32.250 --> 00:19:33.333
Please.

00:19:33.916 --> 00:19:35.333
-Please.
-Please.

00:19:36.916 --> 00:19:40.125
But Hana deceived us all.

00:19:41.125 --> 00:19:44.083
We can't just forgive her
for breaking our trust.

00:19:44.166 --> 00:19:45.000
I…

00:19:49.333 --> 00:19:52.041
I think Hana's a good person.

00:19:52.625 --> 00:19:55.041
I never meant to deceive anyone either.

00:19:56.166 --> 00:19:59.666
At my last job,
people talked behind my back.

00:20:00.666 --> 00:20:01.625
That's why

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:04.875
I decided to stay quiet.

00:20:04.958 --> 00:20:06.291
I'm sorry.

00:20:06.833 --> 00:20:08.083
No, not at all.

00:20:09.916 --> 00:20:11.833
But don't you think

00:20:12.791 --> 00:20:16.125
in some way, we all wear a mask?

00:20:16.625 --> 00:20:17.458
Takuya,

00:20:18.083 --> 00:20:21.375
you actually talk a lot,
and you say good things too.

00:20:22.083 --> 00:20:24.416
Plus, you have a great voice.

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:26.333
That surprised me.

00:20:26.416 --> 00:20:27.958
Same here.

00:20:28.958 --> 00:20:34.000
Chef Kenji accepted me as I am.

00:20:36.208 --> 00:20:40.666
He said, "Here at Le Sauveur,
you can be whoever you want to be."

00:20:41.833 --> 00:20:44.625
"You don't need words to make chocolate."

00:20:45.208 --> 00:20:47.458
"Just your heart is enough."

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.666
That's why, for me,

00:20:52.291 --> 00:20:55.375
I've been happy here at Le Sauveur.

00:20:56.375 --> 00:20:59.708
Because all of you accepted me as I am…

00:21:01.791 --> 00:21:05.375
I'm slowly recovering
from my emotional issues.

00:21:10.333 --> 00:21:11.791
And I think

00:21:13.666 --> 00:21:17.291
Le Sauveur was
that kind of place for Hana too.

00:21:19.666 --> 00:21:24.583
Hana sincerely apologized to us.

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:35.958
To my family at Le Sauveur.

00:21:37.666 --> 00:21:39.208
Hello.

00:21:39.291 --> 00:21:44.166
Since I was little, I've had scopophobia,

00:21:44.666 --> 00:21:47.750
so I can't stand in front of you all.

00:21:49.041 --> 00:21:53.958
Therefore, I hope to convey
my feelings through this letter.

00:21:55.875 --> 00:21:59.791
For a long time,
I'd been Chef Kenji's apprentice.

00:22:00.291 --> 00:22:03.916
I'm the Anonymous Chocolatier, Lee Hana.

00:22:05.916 --> 00:22:09.666
Working with everyone at Le Sauveur

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:11.750
has been a true joy.

00:22:13.333 --> 00:22:15.541
I never meant to deceive you.

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:19.333
Because of my mental illness,

00:22:19.416 --> 00:22:23.166
I've always lived my life
averting my eyes from the world.

00:22:23.666 --> 00:22:26.875
So I lacked confidence

00:22:27.375 --> 00:22:31.500
and thought no one could ever love me.

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:36.708
But after meeting you all

00:22:37.333 --> 00:22:39.583
and working together every day,

00:22:40.083 --> 00:22:46.333
for the first time in my life,
I felt like I had another family.

00:22:47.583 --> 00:22:53.416
That's why I wanted to stay
within that family circle.

00:22:55.125 --> 00:22:58.250
That feeling wasn't a lie.

00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:01.500
Thank you so much.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.708
I'm truly grateful.

00:23:04.375 --> 00:23:07.166
We may never meet again,

00:23:07.666 --> 00:23:09.583
but I'll never forget you.

00:23:18.125 --> 00:23:21.458
She's an employee with no family.
Please let me check if she's okay.

00:23:21.541 --> 00:23:22.708
Understood.

00:23:24.541 --> 00:23:25.916
Thank you.

00:23:57.333 --> 00:23:58.583
She's been here…

00:24:01.708 --> 00:24:03.583
alone, all this time.

00:24:37.333 --> 00:24:40.291
When I went to the Koita Republic before,

00:24:40.875 --> 00:24:44.375
I heard about a rare cacao
that could make the finest chocolate.

00:24:44.458 --> 00:24:47.916
It was called "Godsend."

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.041
I thought maybe
the cacao Chef Kenji's holding here

00:24:53.125 --> 00:24:55.458
is that very one.

00:24:55.958 --> 00:24:58.333
They also call it "purple cacao."

00:24:58.833 --> 00:24:59.666
Well,

00:25:00.791 --> 00:25:02.916
it’s hard to tell the color
from this photo.

00:25:19.875 --> 00:25:20.875
I…

00:25:22.083 --> 00:25:23.875
have feelings for someone.

00:25:25.958 --> 00:25:28.916
But she always runs from me.

00:25:33.958 --> 00:25:35.333
My mother…

00:25:38.541 --> 00:25:39.791
was an alcoholic.

00:25:41.625 --> 00:25:44.041
My father used to beat her every day.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.250
She was a lightweight, but she drank
too much and became addicted.

00:25:51.583 --> 00:25:55.541
When I was little,
she left me and disappeared.

00:25:56.791 --> 00:25:59.625
I hated myself
for not being able to do anything.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.500
And this person I like…

00:26:04.625 --> 00:26:06.291
reminds me of my mother.

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:09.833
She's a different person when she's drunk,

00:26:10.333 --> 00:26:11.708
but she's beautiful…

00:26:13.916 --> 00:26:16.166
and has a heart of gold.

00:26:19.125 --> 00:26:20.291
Lately…

00:26:23.208 --> 00:26:24.416
I've been wondering

00:26:26.166 --> 00:26:29.000
if I'm broken inside too.

00:26:31.583 --> 00:26:32.875
Just like her.

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:37.125
But I've decided to let go of the past

00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:42.750
and choose my own future properly.

00:26:55.125 --> 00:26:58.125
Let's put an end to this.

00:27:00.166 --> 00:27:03.708
I think it's for the best.

00:27:09.458 --> 00:27:13.625
I'm sorry for everything.

00:27:28.833 --> 00:27:29.666
What's this?

00:27:30.708 --> 00:27:37.708
Hana probably went
to the Koita Republic to get cacao.

00:27:38.708 --> 00:27:40.458
Go and bring her back.

00:27:42.416 --> 00:27:43.250
Wait…

00:27:44.416 --> 00:27:48.125
Why… me?

00:27:52.916 --> 00:27:54.125
The other day…

00:27:56.916 --> 00:28:01.041
I saw you two kissing.

00:28:04.125 --> 00:28:05.833
What? When?

00:28:05.916 --> 00:28:08.000
A few days ago. Right here.

00:28:15.291 --> 00:28:16.250
Seriously?

00:28:30.666 --> 00:28:31.916
Irene…

00:28:36.625 --> 00:28:38.666
A-Are you okay?

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:40.208
Hold on.

00:28:54.791 --> 00:28:55.625
Oh.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.500
I came to pick up my coat,

00:29:01.541 --> 00:29:03.875
but you were drunk and asleep.

00:29:06.083 --> 00:29:07.416
Sorry.

00:29:08.041 --> 00:29:13.125
I drank too much.
I don't remember anything.

00:29:13.208 --> 00:29:14.250
I'm sorry.

00:29:15.333 --> 00:29:16.625
It's okay.

00:29:17.125 --> 00:29:19.083
Instead of apologizing…

00:29:27.041 --> 00:29:32.416
please tell her how you really feel.

00:29:36.416 --> 00:29:39.375
You have to gather your courage

00:29:41.333 --> 00:29:44.500
and express your feelings
to the person you like.

00:29:48.708 --> 00:29:49.708
I'll also…

00:29:52.125 --> 00:29:53.583
build up my courage…

00:29:55.583 --> 00:29:57.291
and say it now.

00:30:00.125 --> 00:30:01.291
I've always

00:30:03.083 --> 00:30:06.500
been attracted to you.

00:30:10.208 --> 00:30:13.583
T-To me?

00:30:14.166 --> 00:30:17.458
You probably don't remember it.

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:23.250
When I almost
got into an accident outside here,

00:30:24.250 --> 00:30:26.333
you saved me.

00:30:27.375 --> 00:30:31.500
It's embarrassing, but ever since then,

00:30:32.791 --> 00:30:34.916
I've wanted to see you.

00:30:37.291 --> 00:30:39.166
I even took up kendo.

00:30:40.083 --> 00:30:40.916
All by myself,

00:30:42.833 --> 00:30:44.958
in my own world…

00:30:47.041 --> 00:30:51.875
I went and fell for you.

00:30:53.625 --> 00:30:55.333
I liked you.

00:30:57.625 --> 00:30:59.791
Y-You liked me?

00:31:00.708 --> 00:31:03.500
Thanks to you, I realized something.

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:09.333
What I'm feeling right now is gratitude.

00:31:15.083 --> 00:31:20.416
Thank you so much for everything.

00:31:27.708 --> 00:31:28.541
Um,

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.166
your eyes…

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.291
are always looking
for Sosuke, aren't they?

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:41.625
Feelings that grow so big
you can't hide them

00:31:42.458 --> 00:31:46.666
are sometimes more obvious
to the people around you.

00:31:48.458 --> 00:31:49.708
Also…

00:31:52.083 --> 00:31:55.125
I don't think it was me

00:31:55.958 --> 00:31:57.958
who saved you.

00:31:59.916 --> 00:32:00.833
Huh?

00:32:06.375 --> 00:32:07.708
That's dangerous.

00:32:07.791 --> 00:32:09.541
TAKADA

00:32:09.625 --> 00:32:10.875
Hello?

00:32:10.958 --> 00:32:12.250
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:32:13.083 --> 00:32:14.875
I'm almost there.

00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:24.708
Remember when you brought me
new kendo gear on my birthday?

00:32:25.708 --> 00:32:28.000
You said you saved someone that day.

00:32:29.125 --> 00:32:31.291
Turns out that was Hana.

00:32:32.166 --> 00:32:34.916
Are you guys idiots or what?

00:32:35.791 --> 00:32:36.625
Huh?

00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:39.916
I mean, you're the one Hana likes.

00:32:41.208 --> 00:32:42.333
Me?

00:32:43.083 --> 00:32:44.000
Yeah.

00:32:44.083 --> 00:32:47.166
For a while now, actually.

00:33:37.708 --> 00:33:39.375
Th-Thief!

00:33:39.458 --> 00:33:40.916
Oh, no!

00:34:16.875 --> 00:34:18.166
W-Wait.

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:38.875
I found it!

00:36:04.708 --> 00:36:05.833
Hana!

00:36:58.541 --> 00:36:59.708
How did you…?

00:37:00.208 --> 00:37:03.375
Shh. You're safe now.

00:37:09.916 --> 00:37:11.083
Are you hurt?

00:37:11.916 --> 00:37:14.041
Why did you come here alone?

00:37:16.083 --> 00:37:21.250
I just wanted to help
everyone at Le Sauveur.

00:37:23.833 --> 00:37:24.916
There, there.

00:37:37.083 --> 00:37:38.291
-Mr. Fujiwara!
-Huh?

00:37:38.375 --> 00:37:39.875
Are you okay?

00:37:40.375 --> 00:37:42.083
Are you all right?

00:37:42.166 --> 00:37:43.166
What?

00:37:43.250 --> 00:37:44.208
Hm?

00:37:56.083 --> 00:37:57.333
Are you all right?

00:37:57.416 --> 00:37:59.500
Why would you get hurt?

00:37:59.583 --> 00:38:01.458
I was really worried, you know!

00:38:01.541 --> 00:38:04.208
I'm fine. It's just a scratch.

00:38:04.708 --> 00:38:07.166
Oh, more importantly,

00:38:07.916 --> 00:38:09.708
what did you just say?

00:38:10.791 --> 00:38:11.750
Huh?

00:38:11.833 --> 00:38:16.625
Did you say
you were really worried about me?

00:38:17.708 --> 00:38:18.791
Well…

00:38:21.458 --> 00:38:23.041
That's only natural!

00:38:23.125 --> 00:38:25.666
You got hurt because of me.

00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:28.833
Anyway,

00:38:29.583 --> 00:38:31.750
why did you leave without telling me?

00:38:33.125 --> 00:38:35.458
Don't disappear from my sight again.

00:38:42.166 --> 00:38:43.000
I mean…

00:38:44.291 --> 00:38:45.125
Uh…

00:38:46.333 --> 00:38:52.333
As your boss, I was in trouble
when my employee suddenly disappeared.

00:38:53.541 --> 00:38:56.708
But I'm not your employee anymore.

00:38:58.416 --> 00:39:00.500
I see.

00:39:01.541 --> 00:39:04.166
You're not my employee anymore.

00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:10.416
Oh, but it's different
if you're the Anonymous Chocolatier.

00:39:11.416 --> 00:39:15.041
I'm here on business too.

00:39:15.875 --> 00:39:20.333
To ask the top chocolatier in Japan
with genius-level skills

00:39:21.791 --> 00:39:26.166
to make the best chocolate
for the upcoming competition.

00:39:31.333 --> 00:39:35.875
I'm Sosuke Fujiwara,
president of Le Sauveur.

00:39:37.208 --> 00:39:39.958
Would you be the chocolatier
that represents Le Sauveur

00:39:40.875 --> 00:39:43.708
and compete
in the World Chocolatier Masters?

00:39:48.208 --> 00:39:49.333
Please.

00:40:07.708 --> 00:40:08.583
Ow.

00:40:10.416 --> 00:40:13.625
-A-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:20.750
For now, you seem hungry,
so let's get something to eat.

00:40:22.083 --> 00:40:23.000
Yes.

00:40:23.666 --> 00:40:25.083
I'm hungry.

00:40:30.916 --> 00:40:32.291
This is delicious too.

00:40:32.375 --> 00:40:33.875
Mm! What's this?

00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:43.416
Whoa.

00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:45.333
There's even more food.

00:40:46.041 --> 00:40:48.791
I'm sorry about earlier.

00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:52.250
I was only thinking about myself again.

00:40:53.791 --> 00:40:58.833
I thought winning and proving ourselves
in the competition would save Le Sauveur.

00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:00.458
No.

00:41:02.666 --> 00:41:03.958
If I compete,

00:41:04.916 --> 00:41:09.375
I might ruin everything instead.

00:41:10.333 --> 00:41:12.083
Forget winning.

00:41:15.708 --> 00:41:18.333
I might even run away.

00:41:20.375 --> 00:41:23.083
That's why, for Le Sauveur's sake,

00:41:24.250 --> 00:41:27.666
I had to find Godsend no matter what.

00:41:29.125 --> 00:41:30.708
Even so,

00:41:32.333 --> 00:41:35.375
who comes to a place like this alone?

00:41:35.458 --> 00:41:38.291
Without being scared,
and with just one photo.

00:41:39.833 --> 00:41:42.166
It's like you came looking for a miracle.

00:41:45.041 --> 00:41:46.916
A miracle

00:41:47.916 --> 00:41:50.666
is something that happens in the end.

00:41:51.916 --> 00:41:55.208
I think that's why
the word "miracle" exists.

00:42:00.708 --> 00:42:02.458
You meant it, right?

00:42:04.791 --> 00:42:08.208
That you want to save Le Sauveur?

00:42:12.333 --> 00:42:13.166
Yes.

00:42:14.625 --> 00:42:20.833
Then let's find
that miracle together no matter what.

00:42:23.708 --> 00:42:24.541
Yeah.

00:44:56.166 --> 00:44:58.833
"Le Chocolat du Bonheur."

00:45:03.083 --> 00:45:05.458
The Chocolate of Happiness.

00:45:07.291 --> 00:45:10.500
The Chocolate of Happiness.

00:45:18.375 --> 00:45:23.416
That old lady looked so happy
talking about Chef Kenji's chocolate.

00:45:24.041 --> 00:45:24.875
Yes.

00:45:26.166 --> 00:45:29.000
Slightly flawed and damaged fruit

00:45:29.083 --> 00:45:31.916
was actually a gift from God.

00:45:32.791 --> 00:45:34.875
Now that was the real miracle.

00:45:40.625 --> 00:45:43.291
Even if I'm slightly flawed,

00:45:45.208 --> 00:45:47.541
if you'll accept someone like me…

00:45:51.791 --> 00:45:54.750
I'll enter the competition.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.666
If it's to save the shop,
you don't have to push yourself.

00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:02.583
No.

00:46:03.583 --> 00:46:07.333
This isn't for anyone else. It's for me.

00:46:08.416 --> 00:46:11.875
I don't want to hide anymore.

00:46:12.375 --> 00:46:14.000
I'm done running away.

00:46:18.166 --> 00:46:20.791
Are you sure you'll be okay?

00:46:21.375 --> 00:46:22.208
Of course

00:46:23.041 --> 00:46:25.291
I won't be okay at all.

00:46:28.958 --> 00:46:31.083
I want to be okay,

00:46:31.708 --> 00:46:35.875
but that itself feels like a miracle.

00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:42.208
"A miracle is something
that happens in the end."

00:46:43.041 --> 00:46:46.833
"That's why the word 'miracle' exists."

00:46:46.916 --> 00:46:49.000
Didn't someone say that?

00:46:51.541 --> 00:46:55.875
Even if there's no miracle…

00:46:57.916 --> 00:46:59.708
I'll be by your side.

00:47:00.583 --> 00:47:02.916
Wherever you look, I'll be there.

00:47:08.250 --> 00:47:09.208
Then…

00:47:14.416 --> 00:47:16.166
I take up your offer.

00:47:56.083 --> 00:47:58.458
Oh, um…

00:48:00.166 --> 00:48:04.458
You said we don't need
to practice anymore.

00:48:05.291 --> 00:48:06.166
Right.

00:48:07.291 --> 00:48:09.208
We don't need any more practice.

00:48:10.583 --> 00:48:11.625
So…

00:48:13.166 --> 00:48:15.666
I'm going to build up my courage first.

00:48:18.791 --> 00:48:20.625
This isn't practice.

00:48:22.625 --> 00:48:23.500
It's sarang.

00:48:33.583 --> 00:48:34.500
Sarang.

00:48:40.583 --> 00:48:41.416
Huh?

00:49:08.416 --> 00:49:12.708
Everyone, thank you
for all your hard work.

00:49:13.708 --> 00:49:15.666
The day has finally come.

00:49:16.416 --> 00:49:19.208
Our fund will buy up the company's shares,

00:49:19.708 --> 00:49:22.166
and you'll take control of management.

00:49:22.250 --> 00:49:24.791
I’ll repay you with large returns.

00:49:24.875 --> 00:49:27.000
Please focus on buying them up.

00:49:27.833 --> 00:49:32.333
Okay, everyone, let's keep everything
running smoothly until trading begins.

00:49:32.416 --> 00:49:33.625
Yes, sir.

00:49:38.750 --> 00:49:40.666
I see. Got it.

00:49:41.541 --> 00:49:43.708
Well, it shouldn't be a big problem.

00:49:44.583 --> 00:49:45.416
Yeah.

00:49:45.916 --> 00:49:47.041
See you tomorrow.

00:54:11.125 --> 00:54:14.000
