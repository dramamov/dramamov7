Teacher Liang

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.719
This is coffee I ground by hand.

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:44.080
I added sugar and creamer just for you.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.719
Thank you.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.639
Sorry, sorry, Teacher Liang.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.000
I'll clean it up for you right away.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.439
It's fine. I'll go to the equipment office.

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:57.719
Sorry, Teacher Liang. I didn't mean it.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.520
It's okay. The laptop is waterproof.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.360
There's always a certain scent

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:24.240
and a unique way

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.319
that often reminds us

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.319
where we're headed tomorrow

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.439
and where we came from yesterday.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:33.639
Here, let me do it.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.400
Nian'er, your train ticket home—

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.599
Did you book it for next week?

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.360
It's for next Saturday.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.439
You should buy it early.

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:45.319
Tickets are hard to get these days.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.919
Mm-hmm.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.360
I'll miss you.

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:50.400
Me too.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.039
I'll think of you both.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.759
Take care of yourself, okay?

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.319
Oh, inside this box—

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:58.719
It's your favorite.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:59.680
Over the past year,

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.560
the movie books we've collected together

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.759
and the special edition posters

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:04.159
are yours to keep as a memory.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.800
Thank you both for this time.

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:11.520
Thank you, too.

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:14.360
Let me walk you out.

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:16.120
Okay.

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:37.920
Nian'er, when will you come back?

00:04:38.959 --> 00:04:41.480
Mom, I might not be able to return.

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:42.720
I couldn't get a ticket.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.079
Don't lie to me.

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:46.319
I know you didn't buy a ticket at all.

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:48.639
Do you just not want to come home?

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.120
Nian'er—

00:04:50.519 --> 00:04:52.040
Since your dad passed away,

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.600
I married Uncle Wang.

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:56.240
Life finally got a little better.

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:58.600
Uncle Wang is a good man.

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:00.879
He's been kind to you.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.079
You should treat him and his son

00:05:04.079 --> 00:05:05.759
as family.

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:07.279
You have a home.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.800
Just think of this as your own home.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.800
It's better than drifting outside.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.079
Alright?

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:16.959
Uncle Wang has been

00:05:16.959 --> 00:05:18.639
talking about you these days.

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:21.439
Mom, I know.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.920
I'm doing fine now.

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:25.639
I have work to keep me busy.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.360
My two roommates take good care of me.

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:30.720
So, what do you eat over there?

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.040
Today I had two dishes.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.000
One was sweet and sour ribs,

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.279
the other was cold lotus root salad.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:39.879
Mom, I have to go now.

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:40.839
Someone's knocking.

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:47.360
Coming!

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.240
Fangdong Shushu

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
I heard both of them moved out today.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.920
I'm here to check the apartment.

00:05:59.079 --> 00:06:00.720
When are you planning to—

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:02.800
Uncle, I'm not moving.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.959
That's not what they told me.

00:06:05.959 --> 00:06:07.279
Maybe they misunderstood.

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:08.680
I never said I was moving.

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:11.319
I plan to rent it by myself.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.680
The rent won't be a cent less.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.439
My job is pretty stable.

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:17.639
I won't be late with rent.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.879
But I thought you were leaving too.

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:21.439
I've already rented out the place.

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:22.439
If you break the contract,

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:23.800
I have to pay a thousand yuan penalty.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.040
I'll pay the penalty.

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:31.959
I treat this place as my own home.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.879
I'm used to living here. I have feelings for it.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.959
Alright, get the contract ready.

00:06:58.519 --> 00:07:00.240
Can one of you help me get my phone?

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.639
Ting Jie, this is a bit sudden.

00:08:44.639 --> 00:08:46.600
We don't know what to do.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.200
This is a complicated matter.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.679
Simply put, someone pulled their investment.

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.279
Our funding chain is completely broken.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.039
Ting Jie, in such a short time,

00:08:55.039 --> 00:08:56.559
I can't find another job at all.

00:08:56.799 --> 00:08:57.919
Sorry, Nian'er.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.200
The company really is shutting down.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.600
I can't even take care of myself now.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:02.759
Oh, right—

00:09:03.159 --> 00:09:04.799
For details on compensation and salary,

00:09:04.799 --> 00:09:06.159
just talk to finance directly.

00:09:06.159 --> 00:09:07.279
You won't be shortchanged.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.559
Ting Jie, thank you for your hard work.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.200
There's really not a cent left.

00:09:15.559 --> 00:09:16.759
If you want to sue, go ahead.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.879
Ting Jie asked me to come find you.

00:09:18.879 --> 00:09:20.679
She promised me salary and compensation.

00:09:21.279 --> 00:09:22.279
If you want to sue, go ahead.

00:09:22.279 --> 00:09:23.679
That's exactly what Ting Jie said.

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:48.919
What are you doing?

00:09:50.879 --> 00:09:52.000
Can I post this here?

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.320
You can't post ads there.

00:09:54.399 --> 00:09:55.240
Then I'll post it below.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.039
No, it's against the rules. Take it down.

00:10:22.519 --> 00:10:24.759
If you spend fifteen yuan plus three yuan,

00:10:24.759 --> 00:10:26.759
you can get a nine-yuan drink.

00:10:26.759 --> 00:10:27.679
Would you like to try it?

00:10:28.879 --> 00:10:29.679
No, thank you.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:30.639
Alright.

00:10:33.559 --> 00:10:34.360
Do you need it heated?

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:36.919
Excuse me—

00:10:37.759 --> 00:10:39.519
Can I post a rental ad over there?

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.240
There?

00:10:44.399 --> 00:10:45.120
Thank you.

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:45.840
It's fine.

00:10:46.519 --> 00:10:47.840
No, it's against the rules.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:52.960
Could you please heat this up for me?

00:10:55.919 --> 00:10:56.559
I'm not going.

00:10:56.559 --> 00:10:57.759
I have a date with my boyfriend this afternoon.

00:10:58.919 --> 00:11:00.279
I heard the counselor

00:11:00.279 --> 00:11:01.519
will make you help with the party soon.

00:11:02.559 --> 00:11:04.399
You won't be this free then.

00:11:04.399 --> 00:11:06.600
How about we rent a place together?

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:07.799
Good idea.

00:11:08.399 --> 00:11:10.720
Wow, this cake is so cute!

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.279
But it's a bit too expensive.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.279
We could split it and try it at home.

00:11:16.039 --> 00:11:18.519
Forget it, let's just eat at the cafeteria.

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.399
Alright.

00:11:20.159 --> 00:11:20.960
Hey, wait a second.

00:11:21.919 --> 00:11:23.120
What do you need?

00:11:24.519 --> 00:11:25.879
I have a room for rent.

00:11:25.879 --> 00:11:27.120
Are you interested in seeing it?

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:27.919
A room?

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.840
My place is really nice.

00:11:29.919 --> 00:11:30.960
Warm in winter, cool in summer.

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:31.879
It's close to your school.

00:11:31.879 --> 00:11:33.120
Just five minutes on foot.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.120
Let's go check it out.

00:11:36.759 --> 00:11:37.559
Then let's go.

00:11:38.919 --> 00:11:39.720
Wait a second.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.519
Have you made a decision yet?

00:11:47.639 --> 00:11:48.960
The room is pretty nice.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:51.080
It's just the two of us.

00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.679
We can only pay for one person's rent.

00:11:52.679 --> 00:11:53.559
You know how it is.

00:11:53.679 --> 00:11:55.679
We're both students, not much money.

00:11:55.919 --> 00:11:57.600
We can't even afford a cake.

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.559
But my situation isn't great either.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.519
I just got laid off from my job.

00:12:03.919 --> 00:12:05.080
I don't have any savings.

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.360
You can think it over.

00:12:06.399 --> 00:12:08.399
It's not like we have to rent here.

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:11.360
Rents around here have dropped a lot.

00:12:11.519 --> 00:12:12.720
There are plenty of empty rooms.

00:12:13.039 --> 00:12:13.919
You probably won't

00:12:13.919 --> 00:12:15.759
find new tenants right away, right?

00:12:16.919 --> 00:12:19.519
That's true, but...

00:12:20.279 --> 00:12:21.080
Sorry.

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:24.120
Hello?

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:24.840
Is this Ms. Liang?

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:26.759
Your package is at the door.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:27.759
Package?

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:29.720
Oh, okay.

00:12:32.399 --> 00:12:33.720
Think it over again.

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:34.919
I'll go get my package.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:46.879
Surprise.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:59.399
What's wrong?

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.080
Why aren't you replying to my messages?

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.360
Are you ghosting me?

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.919
Are you acting like Du Fei or He Shuhuan?

00:13:07.919 --> 00:13:08.720
Didn't you tell me last time

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.080
your roommate was moving out?

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:11.639
So I planned to come keep you company.

00:13:11.759 --> 00:13:12.919
I officially moved in today.

00:13:14.279 --> 00:13:15.600
I rented the apartment downstairs.

00:13:17.279 --> 00:13:18.080
Downstairs?

00:13:20.879 --> 00:13:22.080
You just showed up like this?

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:23.360
Your luggage?

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:24.799
I mailed it, hasn't arrived yet.

00:13:26.399 --> 00:13:27.200
I came out first.

00:13:35.399 --> 00:13:36.799
Let's be clear about this.

00:13:36.799 --> 00:13:38.320
We don't share with guys.

00:13:38.639 --> 00:13:39.440
I won't.

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:40.759
You two are here to rent, right?

00:13:41.559 --> 00:13:42.440
Sorry.

00:13:42.879 --> 00:13:44.600
I've got the whole place, people and all.

00:13:44.679 --> 00:13:45.840
You two should head back.

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:54.360
Sorry.

00:13:57.919 --> 00:13:59.600
Du Peng, are you really moving in?

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.399
Of course.

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.000
I'll be with you in the day, downstairs at night.

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:06.000
I'll cover rent for the other two rooms.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:09.799
We share the good, I take the bad.

00:14:10.639 --> 00:14:11.759
You're just

00:14:11.759 --> 00:14:13.360
paying for two extra rooms

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.360
and commuting half an hour more.

00:14:15.519 --> 00:14:16.600
Doesn't seem right.

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.000
Then make up for it in other ways.

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:23.159
Like what?

00:14:23.879 --> 00:14:24.799
Oh, right!

00:14:31.679 --> 00:14:32.639
What is it?

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.559
This is my most important stuff.

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:37.720
My laptop.

00:14:39.159 --> 00:14:40.120
You have to keep it safe for me.

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:41.799
There's a lot of important stuff inside.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.559
Keep it dry, clean, and secure.

00:14:44.559 --> 00:14:45.759
No, protect it from falling.

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:46.840
Don't worry.

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:53.960
This Mapo Tofu

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:55.279
isn't enough for both of us.

00:14:55.279 --> 00:14:56.559
It's Mapo Tofu.

00:14:59.039 --> 00:14:59.679
Let's go.

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:00.720
Where to?

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:01.480
Out to eat.

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:13.279
Here.

00:15:16.679 --> 00:15:17.679
Haven't had this in ages.

00:15:17.679 --> 00:15:18.799
Try mine.

00:15:23.399 --> 00:15:24.200
Is it good?

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.120
Tastes just like before.

00:15:26.919 --> 00:15:27.720
Add some vinegar.

00:15:27.879 --> 00:15:28.919
A little, just a bit.

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:30.720
Want to try mine?

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.320
Mine has scallions, right?

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.519
I'll take the scallions out.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:41.799
Tastes good, right?

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:45.759
Wait a sec.

00:16:36.519 --> 00:16:37.679
I'm so full.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.360
Work's over, let's go.

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:49.159
Let's sit a bit longer.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:52.399
Okay.

00:17:13.759 --> 00:17:15.920
Hey, did you take the wrong box?

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:17.640
Why is this box full of kitchenware?

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:20.720
Oh, must've grabbed the wrong one.

00:17:21.079 --> 00:17:21.799
So what now?

00:17:21.799 --> 00:17:22.920
Come back and get it.

00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:25.160
We're already in the car.

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:27.279
Just keep the kitchenware.

00:17:27.559 --> 00:17:28.920
I can't cook.

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.039
Learn! You're smart.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.519
I haven't found a job yet.

00:17:39.359 --> 00:17:42.519
Du Peng is picky and loves to eat.

00:17:43.839 --> 00:17:46.039
I might as well learn to cook.

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.200
That way we save on living costs.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.319
And we can eat healthier together.

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:53.000
Let's get through this together.

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:07.759
Peel the potato, slice and shred.

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:15.319
No problem, I got this.

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:18.839
Slice and shred.

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:22.359
Can't do complicated dishes.

00:18:22.359 --> 00:18:23.599
Start with something simple.

00:18:25.039 --> 00:18:26.240
These seeds—

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:28.240
Should I remove them all?

00:18:30.559 --> 00:18:31.759
Scallion pieces.

00:18:32.799 --> 00:18:34.519
How long is a "piece"?

00:19:27.039 --> 00:19:28.240
Looks cooked.

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:29.440
Stir a couple more times.

00:19:35.319 --> 00:19:37.960
This is the first dish I've ever made.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:40.559
Dinner's ready.

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.359
Gotta post this online.

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:53.240
Stop filming.

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:54.559
The shredded potatoes look ugly.

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:56.039
Not ugly.

00:19:58.039 --> 00:20:00.039
It's Nian'er's first-ever dish.

00:20:00.319 --> 00:20:01.480
We have to show it off.

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:05.960
Alright.

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:08.680
Let's eat.

00:20:09.319 --> 00:20:10.440
Done, posted.

00:20:11.599 --> 00:20:13.240
Come on, try one!

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.000
Eat more.

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:26.519
You eat too.

00:20:27.039 --> 00:20:27.839
I'll eat too.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000
So good with rice.

00:20:36.799 --> 00:20:38.000
Just looks a bit ugly.

00:20:39.519 --> 00:20:40.920
Not ugly, not at all.

00:20:41.319 --> 00:20:42.920
This chili isn't spicy, try it.

00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:58.200
Why'd you stop eating?

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.599
Promise me something, okay?

00:21:09.039 --> 00:21:09.839
What is it?

00:21:10.559 --> 00:21:13.319
No matter what happens in the future,

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:16.359
let's never split up.

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:22.519
Okay.

00:21:43.279 --> 00:21:44.480
Let's try something new today.

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:47.079
Eggs are ready when they're just set.

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:51.519
They'll cook a bit more later.

00:21:51.519 --> 00:21:52.759
No need to cook them all the way.

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:57.440
The secret to this dish

00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:59.880
is not stir-frying, but stewing.

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:13.039
Add some sugar.

00:22:13.039 --> 00:22:14.759
To balance the tomato's sourness.

00:22:21.319 --> 00:22:22.720
You look great when you're cooking.

00:22:24.519 --> 00:22:25.519
Go wait outside.

00:22:25.519 --> 00:22:26.480
It'll be ready soon.

00:22:40.319 --> 00:22:41.559
What's wrong with you today?

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:47.599
At work, I'm just like this tomato.

00:22:48.559 --> 00:22:49.920
All stir-fried and falling apart.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.359
I still got laid off.

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:01.200
It's okay.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.400
If they let you go, it's their loss.

00:23:09.839 --> 00:23:10.920
As long as we're together,

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:13.200
I'm not afraid of any hardship.

00:24:09.119 --> 00:24:10.640
I graduated from a top university.

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:15.279
I was a mid-level manager at a big 996 tech company.

00:24:16.279 --> 00:24:17.680
Right after graduation, my salary was hundreds of thousands.

00:24:25.599 --> 00:24:26.960
Now I've been job hunting for so long,

00:24:29.039 --> 00:24:30.119
and I still can't find a job.

00:24:35.839 --> 00:24:36.640
I...

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:45.160
I know you're feeling down right now.

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:47.519
But you have to believe

00:24:47.839 --> 00:24:49.319
this is all just temporary.

00:24:50.119 --> 00:24:52.079
I feel like I've given it my all.

00:25:09.079 --> 00:25:10.839
If I leave a big 996 tech company,

00:25:12.839 --> 00:25:14.359
does that mean I can't survive?

00:25:23.119 --> 00:25:24.599
This isn't anyone's fault.

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:27.240
It's not about trying your best or not.

00:25:27.559 --> 00:25:30.119
You just need some patience right now.

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:32.920
And don't be so hard

00:25:41.119 --> 00:25:42.279
Let's eat.

00:26:00.039 --> 00:26:02.440
Everything in the kitchen

00:26:02.799 --> 00:26:05.039
feels like an old friend coming home.

00:26:05.759 --> 00:26:08.920
They slowly and steadily gather around me.

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:13.759
I'm starting to take charge of my own kitchen.

00:26:14.559 --> 00:26:15.880
But I don't know

00:26:16.839 --> 00:26:19.839
if I can take charge of my life ahead.

00:26:34.799 --> 00:26:35.559
Nian'er.

00:26:35.559 --> 00:26:36.279
Hey.

00:26:36.519 --> 00:26:37.920
I'm heading out for a bit.

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.039
Come back soon.

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:41.839
I made your favorite Shuizhu Roupian (Spicy Boiled Pork Slices) today.

00:26:42.519 --> 00:26:43.319
Okay.

00:28:36.319 --> 00:28:42.279
Hello, the number you dialed is powered off.

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:05.480
Du Peng.

00:31:49.799 --> 00:31:52.279
But having Shuizhu Roupian for a late-night snack,

00:31:52.279 --> 00:31:53.720
isn't that a bit too sinful?

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:54.960
Not at all.

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:55.680
No.

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:40.920
What? What did you say?

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:42.880
She nodded when I said you two were together.

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:43.680
No, no.

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:44.720
She thought about it for a moment.

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:47.039
I thought you said Yin Zhanqi.
