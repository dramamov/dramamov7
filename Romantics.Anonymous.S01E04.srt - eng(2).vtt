00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Isn't my cat adorable?

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.458
She passed away recently, at 12 years old.

00:00:20.375 --> 00:00:25.166
I cried more than I did
when my husband of many years died.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.458
It made me feel heartless,
like a terrible person.

00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:33.083
And I felt even more depressed.

00:00:36.416 --> 00:00:39.708
I don't think tears
can truly measure someone's sadness.

00:00:40.416 --> 00:00:43.291
Maybe it wasn't that you were
sadder about losing your cat,

00:00:43.375 --> 00:00:47.375
but rather that you were coming to terms
with your husband's passing.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.166
You're right.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.708
I still can't believe he's gone.

00:00:57.625 --> 00:01:00.291
It just feels like
he hasn't come back from work.

00:01:00.375 --> 00:01:03.500
I keep expecting him
to open the door and say, "I'm home."

00:01:05.833 --> 00:01:10.375
I'm scared that if I cry,
it'll make it real.

00:01:10.916 --> 00:01:13.458
Do you have any other family?

00:01:14.041 --> 00:01:18.333
Being around others
helps at times like this.

00:01:18.416 --> 00:01:22.375
To be honest,
I haven't really kept in touch with them.

00:01:22.875 --> 00:01:27.416
But lately, my kids
have been visiting with the grandkids,

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.041
thinking I must be lonely.

00:01:29.125 --> 00:01:31.583
And yet, it's bothersome…

00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:33.541
No, not bothersome, exactly.

00:01:34.166 --> 00:01:36.583
I just don't know how to act around them.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.750
Even with family,

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:44.291
relationships take practice.

00:01:47.041 --> 00:01:48.291
Practice…

00:01:53.083 --> 00:01:54.583
Practice…

00:02:02.791 --> 00:02:04.583
CHEF KENJI GAVE ME YOUR NUMBER.

00:02:04.666 --> 00:02:07.166
I'M SORRY I WAS LATE.
YOU FORGOT YOUR COAT.

00:02:10.125 --> 00:02:13.458
SORRY FOR MISSING OUR APPOINTMENT
AND REPLYING SO LATE.

00:02:16.416 --> 00:02:17.500
HIRO

00:02:27.875 --> 00:02:28.833
Hello?

00:02:28.916 --> 00:02:30.708
Oh, hello?

00:02:31.208 --> 00:02:36.916
Um, we were supposed to meet
at Cielo on Valentine's Day.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.833
Yes.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.958
I know.

00:02:40.041 --> 00:02:42.666
Sorry for all the messages.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.333
So, I still have the coat you left behind.

00:02:47.416 --> 00:02:48.250
Oh.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.833
If you don't mind,
I'd like to come get it.

00:02:54.708 --> 00:02:57.958
Oh, then are you free
on Wednesday around lunchtime?

00:02:59.666 --> 00:03:00.500
Yes.

00:03:01.083 --> 00:03:03.125
Let's meet on Wednesday at 12:00 p.m.

00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:05.208
at Cielo.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.458
Okay.

00:03:18.791 --> 00:03:23.416
What am I thinking?
There's no way I can go!

00:03:24.208 --> 00:03:27.125
Ugh, I'm such an idiot!

00:03:29.083 --> 00:03:30.958
JERK

00:03:35.208 --> 00:03:36.166
Yes?

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.375
Oof, you sound grumpy from the get-go.

00:03:39.875 --> 00:03:43.208
What is it? It's my day off, you know.

00:03:43.708 --> 00:03:45.208
Well, uh,

00:03:45.708 --> 00:03:49.166
I was wondering
if you'd like to practice tomorrow.

00:03:50.541 --> 00:03:52.250
Practice?

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.708
How about we go out for lunch?

00:03:56.291 --> 00:03:57.333
What?

00:03:57.833 --> 00:04:00.333
I think it's better if we eat separately.

00:04:00.833 --> 00:04:01.750
Oh.

00:04:01.833 --> 00:04:04.541
There's a restaurant
I've been curious about.

00:04:04.625 --> 00:04:07.000
I finally managed to get a table.

00:04:08.125 --> 00:04:09.833
It's called Cielo.

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:11.416
Cielo?

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.666
-I'll hang up if you're not interested.
-No, no!

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.416
Sounds great.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.000
Cielo it is!

00:04:17.083 --> 00:04:19.291
Let's practice, yeah!

00:04:41.333 --> 00:04:46.208
BONBON SAKURA

00:05:03.833 --> 00:05:05.416
Are you ready to order?

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.666
Oh, I'll have the chef's choice.

00:05:10.291 --> 00:05:11.583
The same for you?

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.125
-That's all.
-Certainly.

00:05:15.208 --> 00:05:16.375
Thank you.

00:05:20.375 --> 00:05:21.208
Right?

00:05:21.833 --> 00:05:24.000
What do you mean, "Right?"

00:05:24.083 --> 00:05:27.375
Don't you feel comfortable
with me in front of you?

00:05:28.291 --> 00:05:33.041
This face is the only one in the world
you can look directly at, after all.

00:05:33.708 --> 00:05:36.833
Sure, but it's not a face I want to see.

00:05:38.333 --> 00:05:44.416
Then picture the man you said you like.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Excuse me.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.625
I need to use the restroom.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.125
I'm not even giving a presentation.
Why am I sweating so much?

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:15.666
Can I

00:07:16.916 --> 00:07:19.291
practice one more time?

00:07:22.125 --> 00:07:22.958
Sure.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.208
I don't mind.

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:38.875
Excuse me.

00:07:40.125 --> 00:07:42.666
What am I doing?

00:07:52.083 --> 00:07:53.666
Sorry about that.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.666
I thought maybe you'd left.

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:58.250
Of course not.

00:07:58.333 --> 00:08:00.291
You kept disappearing though.

00:08:00.375 --> 00:08:01.666
Yeah, well,

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:03.750
I have my reasons.

00:08:04.916 --> 00:08:05.875
Mr. Fujiwara.

00:08:06.833 --> 00:08:08.583
-Sorry.
-My apologies.

00:08:08.666 --> 00:08:10.333
-Sorry for startling you.
-It's fine.

00:08:10.416 --> 00:08:12.750
-I was just with your father.
-Huh?

00:08:14.791 --> 00:08:16.083
Good afternoon, sir.

00:08:18.833 --> 00:08:22.083
This is Mr. Sasaki
from Quick Mart Holdings.

00:08:22.166 --> 00:08:25.250
Nice to meet you. I'm Sosuke Fujiwara
from Futago Confectionery.

00:08:25.333 --> 00:08:26.291
I'm Sasaki.

00:08:27.208 --> 00:08:28.458
Pleasure to meet you.

00:08:33.458 --> 00:08:34.625
Oh!

00:08:35.708 --> 00:08:37.250
Nice to meet you, sir.

00:08:37.333 --> 00:08:39.208
Nice to meet you.

00:08:39.291 --> 00:08:42.500
She's currently working
as my assistant at Le Sauveur--

00:08:42.583 --> 00:08:43.500
Mr. Sasaki.

00:08:44.083 --> 00:08:46.500
-Thank you for your time today.
-Likewise.

00:08:57.791 --> 00:09:01.208
I'm sorry. Did I overstep?

00:09:01.291 --> 00:09:03.416
Not at all. I appreciate it.

00:09:14.083 --> 00:09:19.375
Who knew having a meal
would be so hard for us?

00:09:19.458 --> 00:09:21.041
I know.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.291
Who'd want to go on a date

00:09:25.708 --> 00:09:27.166
with someone like me?

00:09:30.291 --> 00:09:31.333
Well,

00:09:32.833 --> 00:09:36.333
when you're with someone you like,
those things wouldn't matter, right?

00:09:36.833 --> 00:09:40.125
Just sitting quietly together
like this is enough.

00:09:40.666 --> 00:09:42.125
Maybe, but…

00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:47.541
Nah. It'd still be too hard.

00:09:48.291 --> 00:09:50.708
If, unlike you,

00:09:51.208 --> 00:09:56.583
they were handsome,
kind, and smelled nice,

00:09:57.208 --> 00:09:58.750
I'd be so nervous.

00:10:00.041 --> 00:10:02.416
W-Wait, what?

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:03.833
Hold on.

00:10:04.833 --> 00:10:08.875
So, compared to the guy you like,

00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:11.750
I'm ugly,

00:10:12.833 --> 00:10:13.916
unkind,

00:10:14.916 --> 00:10:16.291
and smelly?

00:10:16.375 --> 00:10:17.875
Obviously.

00:10:18.375 --> 00:10:19.833
I'm not smelly!

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:23.708
Maybe a little.

00:10:23.791 --> 00:10:24.666
What?

00:10:25.166 --> 00:10:28.000
I'm not smelly. Come on!

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.541
Maybe that person also
has sides you don't know about.

00:10:32.041 --> 00:10:36.666
Seeing him from afar might be different
from meeting him in person.

00:10:37.833 --> 00:10:40.625
Hmm. You think so?

00:10:44.958 --> 00:10:45.791
Hey.

00:10:46.458 --> 00:10:47.583
You've got something.

00:10:48.083 --> 00:10:48.916
Hm?

00:10:51.375 --> 00:10:52.208
Here.

00:10:53.875 --> 00:10:54.791
Right here.

00:11:12.208 --> 00:11:13.250
Oh, right.

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:16.250
Sorry, are you okay?

00:11:17.375 --> 00:11:18.208
Absolutely…

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:20.875
not okay.

00:11:28.958 --> 00:11:31.125
This sure isn't easy.

00:11:46.458 --> 00:11:49.958
Doesn't this feel like a date scene
from a romance series?

00:11:50.625 --> 00:11:53.000
You skip the fancy restaurant

00:11:53.583 --> 00:11:56.333
and end up eating burgers
in the car together.

00:11:56.416 --> 00:12:00.041
But somehow, they taste even better.

00:12:00.625 --> 00:12:05.375
It feels like it's just you two,
alone in the world.

00:12:05.458 --> 00:12:07.583
It wasn't like that.
Don't stretch the truth.

00:12:07.666 --> 00:12:11.000
And before you knew it,
you'd fallen for her.

00:12:11.083 --> 00:12:11.916
Huh?

00:12:12.416 --> 00:12:15.041
She's already in love with someone else.

00:12:15.125 --> 00:12:17.000
That's why we're practicing.

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:20.625
I really do hope
she ends up with that person.

00:12:20.708 --> 00:12:23.250
Wait, so it's a love triangle?

00:12:23.333 --> 00:12:24.333
Hey.

00:12:24.416 --> 00:12:28.500
Wow, this is getting exciting!

00:12:32.125 --> 00:12:37.416
"If our liqueur is truly necessary,
I'd like to meet the new president."

00:12:38.375 --> 00:12:40.958
It sounds polite,
but it's basically a threat.

00:12:41.041 --> 00:12:42.375
What should we do?

00:12:44.791 --> 00:12:46.250
Does it have to be me?

00:12:46.875 --> 00:12:48.041
Naoko Hosen.

00:12:48.791 --> 00:12:50.541
She's the proprietress.

00:12:55.791 --> 00:12:58.166
Oh, boy.

00:13:03.291 --> 00:13:07.708
Sorry to interrupt, Chief.
I just received this letter.

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:09.458
What is it?

00:13:11.916 --> 00:13:15.750
What can you tell me
about Gabriel Blossom?

00:13:16.666 --> 00:13:20.333
I hear their president's
pretty tough to deal with.

00:13:21.166 --> 00:13:23.500
She's strict and intimidating,

00:13:23.583 --> 00:13:28.750
and when choosing partners,
she grills you like in a job interview.

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:33.458
I only heard about her from Chef Kenji.

00:13:33.541 --> 00:13:38.375
Fail to answer her questions,
and she won't sign with you.

00:13:38.458 --> 00:13:40.583
It's like an actual interview.

00:13:40.666 --> 00:13:44.041
She asks about history, world geography,

00:13:44.125 --> 00:13:46.958
and even environmental issues, apparently.

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:51.083
Don't worry, everyone.

00:13:51.166 --> 00:13:54.416
He has the credentials
of a top university graduate.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:03.208
Does it have to be
Gabriel Blossom's liqueur?

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:05.208
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:14:09.875 --> 00:14:12.291
Got it. Thank you.

00:14:37.541 --> 00:14:39.791
CIELO 12:00 P.M.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.416
Chef Kenji,

00:14:47.666 --> 00:14:49.375
wish me luck.

00:14:50.625 --> 00:14:52.708
I'll try to be brave.

00:14:57.208 --> 00:14:59.625
TABLE MANNERS FOR ADULTS

00:15:21.333 --> 00:15:23.458
The only natural
spring water liqueur in Tokyo.

00:15:23.541 --> 00:15:26.333
It was founded in 1965…

00:15:31.791 --> 00:15:36.416
WILL YOU COME TO GABRIEL BLOSSOM TOMORROW
WITH ME? YOU'RE FREE, RIGHT?

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:39.875
I'M NOT. I'VE GOT PLANS.

00:15:39.958 --> 00:15:41.958
THAT'S PRETTY COLD.

00:15:56.416 --> 00:15:58.750
Oh, nice color.

00:15:59.291 --> 00:16:00.708
Yeah, so bright.

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:05.291
I thought I bought a skirt.

00:16:06.625 --> 00:16:08.916
I was wondering when I'd ever wear this.

00:16:11.458 --> 00:16:12.416
This one?

00:16:13.291 --> 00:16:14.250
Or this?

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.083
This one?

00:16:18.916 --> 00:16:21.458
-Welcome.
-I have a reservation under Takada.

00:16:21.541 --> 00:16:23.750
We've been expecting you. Right this way.

00:16:49.750 --> 00:16:50.875
What are you doing?

00:16:50.958 --> 00:16:52.250
Mr. Fujiwara?

00:16:52.333 --> 00:16:53.833
Come with me.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000
What?

00:16:56.541 --> 00:16:59.458
Let's go to Gabriel Blossom together.

00:17:00.708 --> 00:17:02.916
I told you, I'm not going.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.541
You're free, aren't you?

00:17:04.625 --> 00:17:07.875
I'm not. I have plans.

00:17:11.041 --> 00:17:12.083
Get in, quickly!

00:17:12.166 --> 00:17:13.125
Huh?

00:17:13.208 --> 00:17:15.041
You're holding up traffic.

00:17:17.708 --> 00:17:18.708
Hurry!

00:17:20.916 --> 00:17:22.750
Ugh, fine!

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:34.958
You can't just drag me along like this.

00:17:35.041 --> 00:17:38.833
Sorry. I just couldn't go alone.

00:17:38.916 --> 00:17:40.916
There's no one else I can ask.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.625
-What about Chief Motomi?
-She scares me.

00:17:43.708 --> 00:17:45.666
-Your secretary?
-He's at HQ today.

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:48.208
Why today of all days?

00:17:48.291 --> 00:17:50.750
Aren't you happy to help Le Sauveur?

00:17:50.833 --> 00:17:53.166
Still, why today of all days?!

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:57.416
Are your plans really more important
than Rainbow Palette's crisis?

00:17:58.708 --> 00:17:59.708
Ssagaji.

00:18:00.208 --> 00:18:02.125
-What?
-Pull over for a moment.

00:18:05.708 --> 00:18:07.625
You want me to go instead?

00:18:08.125 --> 00:18:11.750
I know I could cancel over the phone,

00:18:12.666 --> 00:18:16.875
but I've already stood him up once,
so I feel terrible.

00:18:18.541 --> 00:18:21.250
I know it's a lot to ask…

00:18:22.958 --> 00:18:23.916
Well,

00:18:24.541 --> 00:18:27.958
that would be overstepping
into your personal life, so I can't.

00:18:28.041 --> 00:18:30.791
You're the only one I can ask.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.416
Please, Doctor.

00:18:35.416 --> 00:18:39.125
I just have to go say hello
and pick up the coat, right?

00:18:41.583 --> 00:18:44.250
What's he like? How will I recognize him?

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:46.208
You'll know when you see him.

00:18:47.458 --> 00:18:49.000
He's handsome

00:18:49.666 --> 00:18:54.541
and probably smells amazing
even without showering for days.

00:18:55.958 --> 00:18:58.666
You don't meet people like him often,

00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:00.541
so you'll know right away.

00:19:02.375 --> 00:19:06.375
It seems like your heart
is starting to open up to me, Darth Vader.

00:19:06.458 --> 00:19:09.041
As thanks for showing
your face for the first time,

00:19:09.125 --> 00:19:10.833
I'll go in your place.

00:19:10.916 --> 00:19:13.750
Really? Thank you so much!

00:19:14.916 --> 00:19:15.750
Oh.

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:20.541
Ssagaji.

00:19:21.833 --> 00:19:22.708
Cheap.

00:19:23.208 --> 00:19:24.333
"Cheap"?

00:19:27.541 --> 00:19:28.916
Ssagajiro.

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:31.375
To go buy.

00:19:31.458 --> 00:19:32.458
That scared me.

00:19:35.416 --> 00:19:36.958
Let's get going.

00:19:37.041 --> 00:19:38.875
Is everything okay?

00:19:40.166 --> 00:19:41.000
Wait.

00:19:42.125 --> 00:19:44.166
Are you wearing makeup?

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:46.708
What if I'm not okay?

00:19:46.791 --> 00:19:51.250
You rushed me earlier, saying,
"Get in! You're holding up traffic!"

00:19:51.333 --> 00:19:53.333
Now you're acting all concerned.

00:19:59.916 --> 00:20:01.166
Okay, then. Let's go.

00:20:34.166 --> 00:20:35.458
No way.

00:20:36.833 --> 00:20:39.083
May I help you, ma'am?

00:20:39.166 --> 00:20:40.125
No, uh…

00:20:50.583 --> 00:20:51.458
Okay.

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:16.208
DR. IRENE: I'M SORRY.
I CAN'T MAKE IT AFTER ALL.

00:21:19.708 --> 00:21:20.541
What's wrong?

00:21:20.625 --> 00:21:25.708
What do I do? This is the second time now.

00:21:25.791 --> 00:21:28.250
He's going to hate me.

00:21:28.333 --> 00:21:29.666
What happened?

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:31.875
Didn't you cancel earlier?

00:21:32.541 --> 00:21:34.250
This is all your fault!

00:21:34.333 --> 00:21:37.833
What now?
How are you going to fix this?!

00:21:37.916 --> 00:21:39.791
Hey! Your phone's ringing.

00:21:39.875 --> 00:21:41.166
HIRO

00:21:44.541 --> 00:21:48.500
If it's someone that important to you,
you should've given them a call.

00:21:53.791 --> 00:21:55.625
Please do it properly.

00:21:56.416 --> 00:22:00.208
If we lose this deal, I'll be furious.

00:22:00.291 --> 00:22:01.916
Absolutely furious!

00:22:02.708 --> 00:22:03.666
Oh.

00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:05.083
Take a look.

00:22:05.583 --> 00:22:06.666
It's like snow.

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:07.583
Huh?

00:22:10.958 --> 00:22:12.375
Wow.

00:22:13.708 --> 00:22:14.958
It's beautiful.

00:23:05.208 --> 00:23:06.416
A cedar ball!

00:23:10.833 --> 00:23:13.833
GABRIEL BLOSSOM

00:23:29.583 --> 00:23:31.291
Please wait here.

00:23:44.625 --> 00:23:46.375
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

00:23:48.625 --> 00:23:53.125
Thank you very much
for coming all this way.

00:23:54.291 --> 00:23:55.958
Please, have a seat.

00:23:59.875 --> 00:24:01.250
I'm from Futago Confectionery…

00:24:03.166 --> 00:24:06.791
I'm Sosuke Fujiwara from Le Sauveur.

00:24:06.875 --> 00:24:10.458
Pleased to meet you. I'm Kiyomi Hosen.

00:24:14.416 --> 00:24:20.291
You were probably expecting
to see my mother.

00:24:20.375 --> 00:24:22.208
Uh, yes.

00:24:23.541 --> 00:24:24.750
Is she here?

00:24:26.958 --> 00:24:28.541
I'm very sorry.

00:24:30.208 --> 00:24:32.458
My mother, who founded this place,

00:24:34.125 --> 00:24:35.500
passed away.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:36.958
What?

00:24:37.708 --> 00:24:39.083
About two years ago.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.625
She left two instructions in her will.

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:51.958
First,

00:24:52.916 --> 00:24:58.041
when a business partner changes president,
request them to come at once.

00:24:59.583 --> 00:25:04.375
You see, she had
this peculiar, difficult test.

00:25:04.875 --> 00:25:10.708
That's why we brazenly asked you
to come all this way.

00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:19.125
The second instruction

00:25:20.166 --> 00:25:25.416
was to not tell anyone about her death

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:27.666
for at least three years.

00:25:28.416 --> 00:25:32.083
Otherwise, rumors would spread quickly

00:25:32.166 --> 00:25:36.125
that the flavor has changed
or that the place has gone downhill,

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.666
even if nothing's different.

00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:42.875
So we were told to wait three years

00:25:43.375 --> 00:25:47.916
before announcing that
she had passed away.

00:25:48.875 --> 00:25:51.250
If no one said anything by then,

00:25:51.333 --> 00:25:53.000
it would mean that we had won.

00:25:55.333 --> 00:25:56.500
Impressive.

00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:01.333
But frankly, I'm exhausted.

00:26:01.416 --> 00:26:06.125
I'm thinking of closing down
Gabriel Blossom.

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:09.375
What?

00:26:09.458 --> 00:26:11.125
It's hard, isn't it?

00:26:11.875 --> 00:26:14.291
Succeeding a great founder, that is.

00:26:15.791 --> 00:26:16.958
It feels like…

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.541
fighting a battle you can't win.

00:26:22.708 --> 00:26:24.250
At best, it's a draw.

00:26:27.916 --> 00:26:29.458
Perhaps

00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:34.125
you feel the same way at Le Sauveur now?

00:26:36.666 --> 00:26:37.791
That's true.

00:26:39.125 --> 00:26:39.958
But--

00:26:40.041 --> 00:26:43.291
I think I've grown tired of
dedicating my life

00:26:44.958 --> 00:26:47.208
to preserving tradition.

00:26:52.958 --> 00:26:53.791
Um…

00:26:56.625 --> 00:26:58.500
I think the flavor you changed recently

00:26:59.833 --> 00:27:01.625
is excellent too.

00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:04.083
Huh?

00:27:04.166 --> 00:27:08.208
It's different
from your mother's recipe, isn't it?

00:27:09.291 --> 00:27:10.291
Most likely,

00:27:11.958 --> 00:27:16.708
you altered how the aroma's extracted.

00:27:20.083 --> 00:27:24.166
You noticed that subtle difference?

00:27:25.958 --> 00:27:26.958
Yes.

00:27:27.041 --> 00:27:30.416
Compared to the original,

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:32.333
I think the new flavor

00:27:32.958 --> 00:27:36.666
is richer and even tastier.

00:27:39.916 --> 00:27:43.250
Do you really think so?

00:27:44.083 --> 00:27:44.916
Yes.

00:27:45.416 --> 00:27:46.541
It's tangier, and…

00:27:47.291 --> 00:27:49.333
Hmm, how should I put it?

00:27:51.958 --> 00:27:54.458
It tastes like spring has arrived.

00:28:04.291 --> 00:28:06.125
That makes me happy.

00:28:09.833 --> 00:28:11.750
I'm so glad.

00:28:13.125 --> 00:28:15.875
Even though I knew it was the right move,

00:28:17.416 --> 00:28:23.083
changing my mother's recipe still made me

00:28:24.458 --> 00:28:26.125
feel guilty.

00:28:28.666 --> 00:28:30.166
It was so painful.

00:28:33.666 --> 00:28:39.500
Maybe I'll keep going
with my own approach a little longer.

00:29:10.583 --> 00:29:12.291
You had a petal on you.

00:29:19.708 --> 00:29:22.666
What do you think that flower is?

00:29:24.541 --> 00:29:25.666
Huh?

00:29:27.166 --> 00:29:30.916
My mother used to enjoy
asking this little riddle.

00:29:33.375 --> 00:29:37.750
Of course, they're not…
cherry blossoms, are they?

00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:42.416
Most cherry blossoms have no scent,
so you can't draw flavor from them.

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:44.916
Right.

00:29:47.291 --> 00:29:48.916
Um…

00:29:49.875 --> 00:29:51.916
The answer is…

00:29:52.916 --> 00:29:55.041
Apricot.

00:29:55.583 --> 00:29:57.541
-Huh? What?
-The answer is?

00:29:59.791 --> 00:30:01.083
Well…

00:30:03.625 --> 00:30:05.458
She'll tell you.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.208
So, what is it?

00:30:12.708 --> 00:30:14.416
Well, uh…

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:19.541
Surely you didn't order our liqueur
without knowing its key ingredient?

00:30:20.375 --> 00:30:22.250
Uh, no…

00:30:23.083 --> 00:30:24.125
Here's a hint.

00:30:24.625 --> 00:30:27.750
It's on the bottle of liqueur
you're holding.

00:30:32.958 --> 00:30:35.708
A-pri-cot.

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:40.291
A-pri-cot.

00:30:41.541 --> 00:30:44.375
A-pri-cot?

00:30:45.416 --> 00:30:47.375
You pass!

00:30:49.541 --> 00:30:54.083
So, what's the name
of the chocolate shop you're opening?

00:30:54.166 --> 00:30:56.541
Oh, it's Le Sauveur.

00:31:00.041 --> 00:31:01.166
Come here.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.958
To thank you for your help,

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:15.750
would you be our very first customer?

00:31:27.791 --> 00:31:29.041
Wow!

00:31:34.208 --> 00:31:35.041
Oh…

00:31:35.708 --> 00:31:37.916
So, they weren't cherry blossoms.

00:31:38.875 --> 00:31:41.333
They were apricot blossoms.

00:31:42.791 --> 00:31:45.833
The taste of the chocolate
Chef Kenji gave me as a child

00:31:45.916 --> 00:31:50.041
became an unforgettable memory for me.

00:31:50.541 --> 00:31:56.375
For a kid, a gift of chocolate
is the ultimate happiness.

00:31:58.375 --> 00:31:59.416
Now then,

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.958
since it wasn't Mr. Fujiwara,
but his staff member who got it right…

00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:12.791
I've decided. You pass!

00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:15.291
We're truly grateful.

00:32:15.375 --> 00:32:17.291
Thank you very much!

00:32:17.791 --> 00:32:24.375
I'll also support
the new traditions of Le Sauveur.

00:32:36.958 --> 00:32:37.958
Thank you.

00:32:38.625 --> 00:32:41.708
I knew bringing
a devoted fan was the right call.

00:32:44.250 --> 00:32:45.625
I'm glad it worked out,

00:32:46.458 --> 00:32:51.458
but thanks to you,
my love life's a complete mess.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.208
Oh, is that so?

00:32:56.083 --> 00:32:58.000
If there's anything I can do…

00:32:58.083 --> 00:32:59.500
There isn't.

00:33:06.166 --> 00:33:07.000
Um…

00:33:08.166 --> 00:33:09.541
But earlier,

00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:11.916
I realized…

00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:17.125
you have an incredible gift, Hana.

00:33:17.625 --> 00:33:20.125
You have the ability
to convey your true feelings.

00:33:20.208 --> 00:33:21.916
Just without eye contact.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.666
Even sitting next to you, I was moved.

00:33:26.875 --> 00:33:27.791
What?

00:33:28.541 --> 00:33:29.375
Uh…

00:33:29.458 --> 00:33:35.666
So, if you tell him how you feel,
I'm sure he'll understand.

00:33:37.875 --> 00:33:40.875
As long as they're not a ssagaji like me,

00:33:42.208 --> 00:33:43.208
but someone good.

00:33:50.083 --> 00:33:51.833
I wonder if I can.

00:33:53.708 --> 00:33:55.000
Gobaek.

00:34:02.125 --> 00:34:07.583
In our last session,
we shared our feelings of loss.

00:34:08.333 --> 00:34:14.250
This time, I'd like for us
to share the positive feelings of love.

00:34:17.166 --> 00:34:18.708
Mr. Luxury Tuna.

00:34:18.791 --> 00:34:21.541
If you've felt love recently,

00:34:21.625 --> 00:34:23.666
would you like to share?

00:34:32.208 --> 00:34:34.958
Feelings of love…

00:34:47.458 --> 00:34:51.208
I've never felt anything like that.

00:34:51.291 --> 00:34:54.375
What? No way! Really?

00:34:54.458 --> 00:34:55.875
Poor thing.

00:34:56.375 --> 00:34:57.541
Are you okay?

00:34:59.416 --> 00:35:00.750
Thanks for today.

00:35:00.833 --> 00:35:03.791
Mr. Marumaru,
will you be at the next session?

00:35:03.875 --> 00:35:05.083
Of course.

00:35:05.166 --> 00:35:06.083
Great. Me too.

00:35:06.166 --> 00:35:07.458
Ms. Lucky Cat.

00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:10.708
Please take this, if you'd like.

00:35:13.166 --> 00:35:16.916
I thought chocolate might help
spark conversations with your grandkids.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.916
For kids, a gift of chocolate
is the ultimate happiness.

00:35:22.666 --> 00:35:25.666
Please enjoy them
when they visit next time.

00:35:26.208 --> 00:35:30.458
They're Le Sauveur chocolates,
with seven different flavors.

00:35:32.791 --> 00:35:34.125
Le Sauveur?

00:35:36.125 --> 00:35:38.416
Oh! If that's a bother--

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:40.708
Not at all. I'll gladly accept.

00:35:42.250 --> 00:35:45.458
For the kids and for me,

00:35:46.041 --> 00:35:48.791
I'm sure this will be a wonderful gift.

00:35:48.875 --> 00:35:52.000
Thank you. I truly appreciate it.

00:35:52.083 --> 00:35:53.166
I'm so glad.

00:36:09.375 --> 00:36:10.791
Gobaek.

00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:14.875
Confession.

00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:12.375
Uh, um…

00:37:12.458 --> 00:37:15.958
Excuse me.
C-Can I talk to you for a moment?

00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:22.083
I'm sorry I missed
our appointment the other day.

00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:26.625
I'm really sorry
for standing you up again and again.

00:37:28.083 --> 00:37:29.041
Um…

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.708
There's something I want to tell you.

00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:38.083
I…

00:37:47.833 --> 00:37:50.458
For a long, long time…

00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:55.041
I've always…

00:37:56.208 --> 00:37:58.250
I've always liked you!

00:37:58.333 --> 00:37:59.166
Huh?

00:38:46.708 --> 00:38:48.625
What do I do?

00:42:53.083 --> 00:42:55.958
